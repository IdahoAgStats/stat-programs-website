However, there is often substantial spatial variation not fully captured by blocking, particularly in large experiments. Although spatial statistics have demonstrated effectiveness in controlling localized spatial variation, they are rarely integrated into analysis of agricultural field experiments. The purpose of this workshop is to provide tools for diagnosing with-field spatial variation and accounting for that spatial variation in statistical analysis of trial data.\nIntended Audience This workshop is open to scientists, students, technicians and anyone else who conducts planned field experiments that are arranged in a regular gridded layout. Attendees will need a laptop with R or SAS installed. Some knowledge of programming in R (if you follow the R track) or SAS (if you follow the SAS track) is assumed: setting a working directory, importing files, loading libraries, calling functions. Familiarity with randomized complete block design and how to analyze that design is also assumed.\nHow to Prepare R\nYou will need a recent version of R, available free through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). While this is sufficient for running R scripts, You may also find it helpful to use RStudio, which provides a nice graphical user interface for R. RStudio can be downloaded here. Additionally, there are several package to download:\n check your system   SAS\nIn order to run the SAS portion of this tutorial, a valid copy of SAS Base and Stat products and a current SAS license are required. This tutorial was built using SAS 9.4 (TS1M5). Although older versions of SAS may also work, we have not evaluated this. Users can also consider downloading and using a free version of SASÂ® On Demand for Academics: Studio.\nThe workshop will use Rstudio and the standard SAS interface for R and SAS code demonstrations, respectively.\nDraft Schedule    Time Topic     9:00 welcome/intro   9:20 diagnosing spatial autocorrelation   10:00 10-minute break   10:10 code demo   11:05 row-by-column designs   11:30 empirical variograms   12:00 1-hour lunch   13:00 questions   13:15 code demo   14:00 10-minute break   14:10 splines + code demo   14:40 model compariso + code demo   15:00 augmented designn + code demo   16:00 Adjourn    This schedule may be adjusted as the workshop unfolds.\nMeet Your Instructors Julia Piaskowski is an agricultural statistician at the University of Idaho, Software Carpentry Certified Instructor and long-time R programmer.\nXin Dai is consulting statistician at Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, Utah State University with 12 years of experience in SAS programming.\n gegin the workshop   ","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"19d4d4562cb706f9721d2923bf7b2956","permalink":"/workshops/spatial_workshop/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workshops/spatial_workshop/","section":"workshops","summary":"Routine inclusion of spatial statistics in planned field experiments","tags":null,"title":"Spatial Recipes for Field Trials","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   Table of Contents  What you will learn Program overview Courses in this program Meet your instructor FAQs    What you will learn  Fundamental Python programming skills Statistical concepts and how to apply them in practice Gain experience with the Scikit, including data visualization with Plotly and data wrangling with Pandas  Program overview The demand for skilled data science practitioners is rapidly growing.

Get the correction R distribution for your operating system. Once downloaded, click on downloaded file, and follow the installation instructions.\nNote that R is updated several times per year. If you installation is a year older or more, consider updating your version of R to the latest version.\nInstall RStudio Rstudio is not R, rather, it is a user interface for accessing R. It is complicated with many features for developers. Despite that, it is still a very helpful R user interface for users of all abilities. It can downloaded here. For most users, the free version of \u0026ldquo;RStudio Desktop\u0026rdquo; should be chosen. Once downloaded, click on downloaded file, and follow the installation instructions.\nInstall Rtools (optional) Only Windows users need to consider this step. This app is for compiling R packages with C, C++ and Fortran code. It is a separate piece of software that has to be downloaded and installed (it is not an R package). Rtools is not needed by all users and if you don\u0026rsquo;t know if you need this, it is absolutely fine to skip this step. If you do think you need this, You can find it here. Download and install.\nRStudio Setup (optional) This is an optional step, but it is highly recommended. This step will prevent RStudio from saving all of your objects in a session to .Rdata file that is then automatically loaded whenever you open R.\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;usethis\u0026quot;); library(usethis) usethis::use_blank_slate()  Why is automatic loading of an .Rdata file not recommended? Because it makes your work less reproducible. You may have created test objects that will unexpectedly interfere with downstream operations or analysis. You may have changed the original data source, but an older version is saved in the .Rdata file. More explanation is given by RStudio.\nIF you are used to opening R and seeing all of your previous objects automatically loaded into the objects pane, this will be an adjustment. The solution is to save your processes into .R scripts that capture all information from packages loaded, file import, all data manipulations and other operations important. If these steps are slow and there is a need to access intermediate objects, these can be saved in tabular formats readable by many applications (e.g. .txt or .csv) or saved as a specific R object (see saveRDS() in the R help files) and reloaded in another session.\nSet up version control (optional) If you use Git or SVN, you can perform Git operations directions from RStudio and interact with remote repositories. If you don\u0026rsquo;t use version control, this step can be skipped. If you do use version control, the command line or other third-party software (e.g. Gitkraken) are fine to use instead or in addition to RStudio\u0026rsquo;s interface. The implementation of git in R is very minimal and can support only a limited number of actions, so you are likely to need to use other software for complicated git actions. It is useful for file additions (equivalent to git add), commits, pushes and pulls.\nYou can set up Git by going to \u0026ldquo;Tools\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Global Options \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Git/SVN\u0026rdquo;.\nThis is not the right space to discuss how to use Git as an R user, but Jenny Bryan wrote a very good tutorial covering this subject.\n","date":1618444800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618444800,"objectID":"8b70804b6afa070131995606b8772ebd","permalink":"/post/getting-r-setup/","publishdate":"2021-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-r-setup/","section":"post","summary":"Some instructions for R installation and your R setup to support reproducible research.","tags":["R","reproducible research"],"title":"Getting R Set Up","type":"post"},{"authors":["Julia Piaskowski"],"categories":["R","reproducible research"],"content":"Make sure your Rstudio session is not saving .rdata automatically: Note: this step requires the usethis package; please install if you do not already have it installed.\nusethis::use_blank_slate()  Save all code you run in an .R or .Rmd file This is your source code. It\u0026rsquo;s as real and as important as your input data. This file should capture a set of actions that can be repeated by another person (e.g. your PI, yourself in the future) including packages loaded, files imported, all data manipulations and the outputs from these actions (e.g. visualisations, analytical outcomes). The idea is to capture your thought process so this can be repeated in full. In most analyses, it is extremely likely* you will revisit a project and need to repeat what has already been done.! Keeping a record of actions will save loads and loads of time because you will not have to expend an effort to recall exactly what you did in previous sessions.\n*This is almost guaranteed to happen!\nRegularly restart your R session Yes, that means wiping all the loaded packaged and objects from the session (if you followed Step 1 in these instructions), but the upside is that your analysis are reproducible. This means future you can repeat those analyses and get the same results back you did earlier!\nYou can restart R by manually closing and opening RStudio. You can also restart the R session with RStudio by navigating to the menu item \u0026ldquo;Session\u0026rdquo; and and selecting \u0026ldquo;Restart R\u0026rdquo;.\nUse R projects This is optional, but it will make your life easier. Whenever you start a new analytical endeavor in R, create an R project by navigating to \u0026ldquo;File\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;New Project\u0026rdquo; in RStudio. There\u0026rsquo;s many options here for setting the directory to place the .rpoj, type of project (e.g. R package, Shiny app or blank), and initializing a git repo. The simplest option is to choose \u0026ldquo;New Project\u0026rdquo; (no special type) and put it in a dedicated directory. The main advantage of projects is that by opening an .Rproj file, the working directory is automatically set to that directory. If you are using a cloud solution for working across different computers or working with collaborators, this will make things easier because you can use relative paths for importing data and outputting files. There would be no more need for this at the top of your script:\nsetwd(\u0026quot;specific/path/to/my/computer\u0026quot;)  Additionally, for setting up gitbooks through bookdown, R packages, Shiny apps, and other complicated R endeavors, the automated set-up through Rprojects can be immensely helpful.\nThis is sometimes referred to as \u0026ldquo;project-oriented workflow.\u0026rdquo; I prefer to have a consistent directory structure like so:\ntop-level-directory â”‚ README.md â”‚ â””â”€â”€â”€data â”‚ file011.txt â”‚ file012.txt â”‚\nâ””â”€â”€â”€scripts â”‚ eda.R â”‚ report.Rmd â”‚\nâ””â”€â”€â”€outputs â”‚ plot1.png â”‚ table1.csv â”‚\nâ””â”€â”€â”€extra some_paper.pdf email.pdf\nI put all raw data needed for analysis into the \u0026lsquo;data\u0026rsquo; directory, any and all programming scripts in the \u0026ldquo;scripts\u0026rdquo; directory, all outputs (plots, tables, intermediate data object) in the \u0026lsquo;outputs\u0026rsquo; directory and everything else ends up \u0026lsquo;extra\u0026rsquo;. Naturally, there are many different directory structures to use and this is just one example. Find something that works best for your needs!\n Use the here package.  This is also optional. It works like Rprojects for setting the working directory. However, for an Rproject to work, you have to open the .Rproj file in RStudio. What if you or your collaborators prefer to open R files directly and start using those? Here will look for the next directory level which there is a .Rproj file and set the working directory there.\nIf you want to import a file, \u0026ldquo;datafile.csv\u0026rdquo; that located in the data directory. Your .R script is actually located in the \u0026lsquo;scripts\u0026rsquo; directory. Normally, if you try to read that in, you need to specify the full path to \u0026ldquo;mydata.csv\u0026rdquo; or set the working directory and use a relative path. Again, these paths will not work if you switch computers or your collaborators are running these scripts on their own systems. This system gets even more complicated when working iwth an .Rmd file. Here\u0026rsquo;s an alternative approach that works the same across files and systems:\nFirst, make sure you have .Rproj file to define the top-level directory.\nlibrary(here) mydata \u0026lt;- read.csv(here(\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;datafile.csv\u0026quot;))  This code will construct this path: \u0026ldquo;data/datafile.csv\u0026rdquo; and execute that command under the assumption that wherever that .rproj is located (going up one directory at a time until it finds it) is where the working directory is set. Putting library(here) into every .R or .Rmd file in a project will resolve these issues.\nUse R environments. Again: optional, but it will make your life easier.\nOften in academia, I might do an analysis, move on to something else and then have to return that analysis months or years later. I probably will have updated R and some or all of the packages used in that analysis. As a result of these updates, my original code may not work at all or may not do the intended actions. What I need are both the older version of R and the older packages. The package \u0026lsquo;renv\u0026rsquo; is a solution. It captures the versions of R and the loaded packages. It also builds a custom package library for your package (and caches this information across other projects using renv).\nStart here: (you need to aslo be using Rprojects since renv is searching for .Rproj file)\nlibrary(renv) renv::init()  If you have a mature project that\u0026rsquo;s not undergoing any further development at this time, this is all you need to do.\nIf you continue to develop your project and install new packages, update your R environment like thus to ensure new or updated packaged are included:\nrenv::snapshot()  If you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with Packrat, this is a replacement for that. This is particularly helpful for things that may have a long life span, like Shiny apps.

(you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a geospatial statistics expert)\n Where to Find This Information This Presentation:\nhttps://github.com/IdahoAgStats/lattice-spatial-analysis-talk  A longer tutorial:\nhttps://idahoagstats.github.io/guide-to-field-trial-spatial-analysis  What Are Barriers to Using Spatial Stats?  Perceived lack of need Unsure of benefits No training in the topic/intimidated by the statistical methodology Limited time to devote to statistical analysis Unclear what would happen to blocking if spatial stats are used very few resources for easy implementation  Spatial Variation in Agricultural Fields Univeristy of Idaho's Parker Farm (Moscow, Idaho)\n Spatial Variation in Agricultural Fields Blocking in Agricultural Fields Blocking versus Spatial Analysis This is not how this works. Blocking is compatible with spatial analysis and recommended for most (all?) field trials.\nThere Are Many Spatial Methods Available    areal data correlated error models     row and column trend exponential   nearest neighbor spherical   separable ARxAR models Gaussian   spatial error model Matern   spatial lag model Cauchy   ARIMA power   splines linear   GAMs many more\u0026hellip;    These Methods Work These Methods Can Be Complex  \u0026hellip;.But\nYou can also integrate spatial methods into gridded field trials without:\n having to know anything about map projections, shapefiles or other geospatial terminology possessing a deep understanding of linear modeling techniques or empirical variograms being an R or SAS programming expert  Knowing these things is helpful, but not essential.\nA Typical Experiment  Experimental treatments fully crossed effects Blocking scheme along the expected direction of field variation  Analysis A typical linear model: $Y_{ij} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j + \\epsilon_{ij}$\nResponse = trial mean + treatment effect + block effect + leftover error\nWe Assume:  The error terms, or residuals, are independent of another with a shared distribution:  $$\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0,\\sigma_e)$$\nEach block captures variation unique to that block and there is no other variation related to spatial position of the experimental plots.   **How often is #2 evaluated?**  Example Analysis Average Yield by Row, Column and Block Standard Analysis of Kimberly, 2013 Wheat Variety Trial  36 soft white winter wheat cultivars 4 blocks 2 missing data points the linear model:  $Y_{ij} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j + \\epsilon_{ij}$\nlibrary(nlme) lm1 \u0026lt;- lme(yield ~ cultivar, random = ~ 1|block, data = mydata, na.action = na.exclude)  What Do The Residuals Look Like? plot(lm1)  What Do The Residuals Look Like Spatially? What Do The Residuals Look Like Spatially? Global Moran\u0026rsquo;s Test for Spatial Autocorrelation $H_0$: There is no spatial autocorrelation $H_a:$ There is spatial autocorrelation!\nThis uses a simple weighting matrix that weights all neighbors that share a plot border (the chess-based \u0026ldquo;rook\u0026rdquo; formation) equally.\n## ## Monte-Carlo simulation of Moran I ## ## data: mydata$residuals ## weights: weights ## omitted: 88, 97 ## number of simulations + 1: 1000 ## ## statistic = 0.15869, observed rank = 997, p-value = 0.003 ## alternative hypothesis: greater  Handling Spatial Autocorrelation in Areal Data Areal data = finite region divided into discrete sub-regions (plots) with aggregated outcomes\nOptions:\n model row and column trends  good for known gradients (hill slope, salinity patterns)   assume plots close together are more similar than plots far apart. The errors terms can be modelled based on proximity, but there is no trial-wide trend  autoregressive models (AR) models utilizing \u0026ldquo;gaussian random fields\u0026rdquo; for continuously varying data (e.g. point data) Smoothing splines nearest neighbor    Basic Linear Model $$Y_{ij} = \\mu + A_i + \\epsilon_{ij}$$ $$\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0,\\sigma)$$\nIf N = 4:\n$$e_i ~\\sim N \\Bigg( 0, \\left[ {\\begin{array}{ccc} \\sigma^2 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0\\ 0 \u0026amp; \\sigma^2 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; \\sigma^2 \u0026amp; 0\\\n0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; \\sigma^2 \\end{array} } \\right] \\Bigg) $$\nThe variance-covariance matrix indicates a shared variance and all off-diagonals are zero, that is, the errors are uncorrelated.\nLinear Model with Autoregressive (AR) Errors Same linear model: $$Y_{ij} = \\mu + A_i + \\epsilon_{ij}$$\nDifferent variance structure:\n$$e_i ~\\sim N \\Bigg( 0, = \\sigma^2 \\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc} 1 \u0026amp; \\rho \u0026amp; \\rho^2 \u0026amp; \\rho^3 \\\n\\rho \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; \\rho \u0026amp; \\rho^2 \\\n\\rho^2 \u0026amp; \\rho \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; \\rho \\\n\\rho^3 \u0026amp; \\rho^2 \u0026amp; \\rho \u0026amp; 1 \\ \\end{array} } \\right] \\Bigg) $$\n $\\rho$ is a correlation parameter ranging from -1 to 1 where 0 is no correlation and values approaching 1 indicate spatial correlation. The \u0026ldquo;one\u0026rdquo; in AR1 means that only the next most adjacent point is considered. There can be AR2, AR3, \u0026hellip;, ARn models.  The Separable AR1 x AR1 model   AR1xAR1 assumes correlation in two directions, row and column. It estimates $\\sigma$, $\\rho_{column}$, and $\\rho_{row}$ often a good choice since plot are rectangular and hence autocorrelation will differ by direction (\u0026ldquo;anistropy\u0026rdquo;)  More Notes on Separable AR1xAR1  From a statistical standpoint, it\u0026rsquo;s one of the more intuitive models The implementation in R is a little shaky  several packages, all hard to use and incompatible with other R packages   It is implemented in SAS Some proprietary software implements this (AsREML), others do not (Agrobase)  Semivariance and Empirical Variograms A measure of spatial correlation based on all pairwise correlations in a data set, binned by distance apart:\n$\\gamma^2(h) = \\frac{1}{2} Var[Z(s+h)-Z(s)]$\n$Z(s)$ = observed data at point $s$.\n$Z(s)$ = observed data at another point $h$ distance from point $s$.\nFor a data set with $N$ observation, there are this many pairwise points:\n$\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$\nEmpirical Variogram This uses semivariance to mathematically relate spatial correlations with distance\nrange = distance up to which is there is spatial correlation sill = uncorrelated variance of the variable of interest nugget = measurement error, or short-distance spatial variance and other unaccounted for variance\nSemivariance \u0026amp; Empirical Variograms  There are many difference mathematical models for explaining semivariance:  exponential, Gaussian, MatÃ©rn, spherical, \u0026hellip;   It is usually used for kriging, or prediction of a new point through spatial interpolation It can also be used in a linear model where local observations are used to predict a data point in addition to treatment effects Bonus: R and SAS are really good at this!

More Notes  When models omit blocking, the predictions may be unchanged or they may worsen. This varies by the agronomic field, but in general, blocking a field trial and including block in the statistical model improves your experimental power and controls experimental error. There is no single spatial model that fits all However, using any spatial model is usually better than none at all When you use spatial covariates, your estimates are better and more precise. This really does help you!  What\u0026rsquo;s Next:  Track row and range information in your trial data set. Look at the tutorial! (we will also add SAS code) Try out a few models and see how it impacts your results.  The Seminar Was Brought to you by\u0026hellip;Statistical Programs!!!
