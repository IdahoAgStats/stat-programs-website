However, there is often substantial spatial variation not fully captured by blocking, particularly in large experiments. Although spatial statistics have demonstrated effectiveness in controlling localized spatial variation, they are rarely integrated into analysis of agricultural field experiments. The purpose of this workshop is to provide tools for diagnosing with-field spatial variation and accounting for that spatial variation in statistical analysis of trial data. The workshop draws heavily from our book on this subject.\nIntended Audience This workshop is open to scientists, students, technicians and anyone else who conducts planned field experiments that are arranged in a regular gridded layout. Attendees will need a laptop with R or SAS installed. Some knowledge of programming in R (if you follow the R track) or SAS (if you follow the SAS track) is assumed: setting a working directory, importing files, loading libraries, calling functions. Familiarity with randomized complete block design and how to analyze that design is also assumed.\nHow to Prepare R\nYou will need a recent version of R, available free through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). While this is sufficient for running R scripts, You may also find it helpful to use RStudio, which provides a nice graphical user interface for R. RStudio can be downloaded here. Additionally, there are several package to download:\n check your system   SAS\nIn order to run the SAS portion of this tutorial, a valid copy of SAS Base and Stat products and a current SAS license are required. This tutorial was built using SAS 9.4 (TS1M5). Although older versions of SAS may also work, we have not evaluated this. Users can also consider downloading and using a free version of SASÂ® On Demand for Academics: Studio.\nThe workshop will use Rstudio and the standard SAS interface for R and SAS code demonstrations, respectively.\nData sets\nThe following files will be used in the workshop:\nNebraska Interstate Nursery, a wheat variety trial arranged in a randomised complete block design with 4 blocks. This data set was first described by W. Stroup (2004) and has been used extensively for spatial analysis.\nLind, a winter wheat variety trial from Washington using an augmented design. This data set was kindly donated by Kimberly Garland Campbell of the USDA-ARS.\nPlease download these in advance so you can run the R and/or SAS scripts in the workshop.\nDraft Schedule    Time Topic     9:00 welcome/intro   9:20 diagnosing spatial autocorrelation   10:00 10-minute break   10:10 code demo   11:05 row-by-column designs   11:30 empirical variograms   12:00 1-hour lunch   13:00 questions   13:15 code demo   14:00 10-minute break   14:10 splines + code demo   14:40 model compariso + code demo   15:00 augmented designn + code demo   16:00 Adjourn    This schedule may be adjusted as the workshop unfolds.\nMeet Your Instructors Julia Piaskowski is an agricultural statistician at the University of Idaho, Software Carpentry Certified Instructor and long-time R programmer.\nXin Dai is consulting statistician at Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, Utah State University with 12 years of experience in SAS programming.\n begin the workshop   This workshop is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.

This attribute of trial data impacts many aspects of spatial analysis   Spatial autocorrelation refers to similarity between points that are close to one another. That correlation is expected to decline with distance. Note that is different from experiment-wide gradients, such as a salinity gradient or position on a slope.\nPlotting One of the easiest ways to diagnose spatial autocorrelation is by plotting data by its spatial position and using a heat map to indicate values of a response variable.\n  While there is always ambiguity associated with using plots for decision making, early exploration of these plots can be helpful in understanding the extent of spatial correlation.\nMoran\u0026rsquo;s I Moran\u0026rsquo;s I, sometimes called \u0026ldquo;Global Moran\u0026rsquo;s I\u0026rdquo; can be used for conducting a hypothesis test on whether there is correlation between spatial units located adjacent to one another.\n$$ I = \\frac{N}{W}\\frac{\\sum_i \\sum_j w_{ij} (x_i - \\bar{x})(x_j - \\bar{x})}{\\sum_i(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\qquad i \\neq j$$\nWhere N is total number of spatial locations indexed by $i$ and $j$, x is the variable of interest, $w_{ij}$ are a spatial weights between each $i$ and $j$, and W is the sum of all weights.\nThe expected values of Moran\u0026rsquo;s I is $-1/(N-1)$. Values greater than the expected value indicate positive spatial correlation (areas close to each other are similar), while values less than that indicate dissimilarity as spatial distance between points decreases.\nDefining Neighbors There are several options for defining adjacent neighbors and how to weight each neighbor\u0026rsquo;s influence. The two common configurations for defining neighbors are the rook and queen configurations. These are exactly what their chess analogy suggests: \u0026ldquo;rook\u0026rdquo; defines neighbors in an row/column fashion, while \u0026ldquo;queen\u0026rdquo; defines neighbors in a row/column configuration an also neighbors located diagonally at a 45 degree angle from the row/column neighbors. Determining this can be complicated when working with irregularly-placed data (e.g. counties), but is quite unambiguous for lattice data common in planned field experiments.\n  Setting the values for weights is a function of both how neighbors are defined and their proximity to the unit of interest. However, a very popular method is to define each neighbor as equal fractions that sum to one, e.g. in rook formation, each neighbor is weighted 0.25 (assuming an interior plot with 4 neighbors).\nEmpirical variogram This is one of the most useful methods of determining the extent of spatial variability and will be covered in the following sections.\nCode for this section R # load libraries library(dplyr); library(ggplot2); library(desplot); library(spdep); library(sf); library(nlme) # read in data and prepare it Nin \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;stroup_nin_wheat.csv\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(col.width = col * 1.2, row.length = row * 4.3) %\u0026gt;% mutate(name = case_when(is.na(as.character(rep)) ~ NA_character_, TRUE ~ as.character(gen))) %\u0026gt;% arrange(col, row) Nin_na \u0026lt;- filter(Nin, !is.na(rep)) # make exploratory plot ggplot(Nin, aes(x = row, y = col)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = yield), col = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) + geom_tileborder(aes(group = 1, grp = rep), lwd = 1.2) + labs(x = \u0026quot;row\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;column\u0026quot;, title = \u0026quot;field plot layout\u0026quot;) + theme_classic() + theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), axis.title = element_text(size = 14), legend.title = element_text(size = 14), legend.text = element_text(size = 12)) ## conduct moran's I test ## # set neighbors with convenience function for grids xy_rook \u0026lt;- cell2nb(nrow = max(Nin$row), ncol = max(Nin$col), type=\u0026quot;rook\u0026quot;, torus = FALSE, legacy = FALSE) # run linear mixed model and extract residuals nin.lme \u0026lt;- lme(fixed = yield ~ gen, random = ~1|rep, data = Nin, na.action = na.exclude) resid_lme \u0026lt;- residuals(nin.lme) names(resid_lme) \u0026lt;- Nin$plot # two version of the Moran's I test: moran.test(resid_lme, nb2listw(xy_rook), na.action = na.exclude) moran.mc(resid_lme, nb2listw(xy_rook), 999, na.action = na.exclude)   SAS # read in data proc format; invalue has_NA 'NA' = .; ; filename NIN url \u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IdahoAgStats/guide-to-field-trial-spatial-analysis/master/data/stroup_nin_wheat.csv\u0026quot;; data alliance; infile NIN firstobs=2 delimiter=','; informat yield has_NA.; input entry $ rep $ yield col row; Row = 4.3*Row; Col = 1.2*Col; if yield=. then delete; run; # heatmap proc sgplot data=alliance; HEATMAPPARM y=Row x=Col COLORRESPONSE=yield/ colormodel=(blue yellow green); run; # linear mixed model proc mixed data=alliance; class Rep Entry; model Yield = Entry / outp=residuals; random Rep; run; # Moran's I proc variogram data=residuals plots(only)=moran ; compute lagd=1.2 maxlag=30 novariogram autocorr(assum=nor) ; coordinates xc=row yc=col; var resid; run;   ","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"bbf124f1c429d14c54ba274fe608c4a2","permalink":"/events/workshops/spatial-workshop/diagnosis/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/events/workshops/spatial-workshop/diagnosis/","section":"events","summary":"This workshop is concerned with areal data, that is, data that occurs in discrete units (plots, in most cases).

When there is spatial autocorrelation, observations closer to one another are correlated, so the off-diagonals in the variance-covariance matrix are not zero.\nSpatial models seek to mathematically model this covariance so it is properly accounted for during hypothesis testing and prediction.\nCode for this section The following scripts build upon work done in previous section(s).\nR library(emmeans); library() # (nlme and gstat should already be loaded) library(spaMM) # for running `corMatern()` # standard linear model nin_lme \u0026lt;- lme(yield ~ gen, random = ~1|rep, data = Nin, na.action = na.exclude) # extract the esimated marginal means for variety preds_lme \u0026lt;- as.data.frame(emmeans(nin_lme, \u0026quot;gen\u0026quot;)) # use information from the variogram fitting for intialising the parameters nugget \u0026lt;- Nin_variofit_gau$psill[1] range \u0026lt;- Nin_variofit_gau$range[2] sill \u0026lt;- sum(Nin_variofit_gau$psill) nugget.effect \u0026lt;- nugget/sill # initalise the covariance structure (from the nlme package) cor.gaus \u0026lt;- corSpatial(value = c(range, nugget.effect), form = ~ row.length + col.width, nugget = T, fixed = F, type = \u0026quot;gaussian\u0026quot;, metric = \u0026quot;euclidean\u0026quot;) # update the rcbd model nin_gaus \u0026lt;- update(nin_lme, corr = cor.gaus) # extract predictions for 'gen' preds_gaus \u0026lt;- as.data.frame(emmeans(nin_gaus, \u0026quot;gen\u0026quot;) # a similar procedure can be follow for other models # but we are going to take a shortcut and not specify the parameters # exponential cor.exp \u0026lt;- corSpatial(form = ~ row.length + col.width, nugget = T, fixed = F) nin_exp \u0026lt;- update(nin_lme, corr = cor.exp) preds_exp \u0026lt;- as.data.frame(emmeans(nin_exp, \u0026quot;gen\u0026quot;)) # Matern structure cor.mat \u0026lt;- corMatern(form = ~ row.length + col.width, nugget = T, fixed = F) nin_matern \u0026lt;- update(nin_lme, corr = cor.mat) preds_mat \u0026lt;- as.data.frame(emmeans(nin_matern, \u0026quot;gen\u0026quot;)   SAS proc mixed data=alliance ; class entry rep; model yield = entry ; random rep; lsmeans entry/cl; ods output LSMeans=NIN_RCBD_means; title1 'NIN data: RCBD'; run; proc mixed data=alliance maxiter=150; class entry; model yield = entry /ddfm=kr; repeated/subject=intercept type=sp(gau) (Row Col) local; parms (11) (22) (19); lsmeans entry/cl; ods output LSMeans=NIN_Spatial_means; title1 'NIN data: Gaussian Spatial Adjustment'; run;   ","date":1636243200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636243200,"objectID":"02c2e4c9ad0bb229f418ece4e4e7af01","permalink":"/events/workshops/spatial-workshop/correlated-error-models/","publishdate":"2021-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/events/workshops/spatial-workshop/correlated-error-models/","section":"events","summary":"Now that we have a sense of how to model spatial variation, the next step is to incorporate that into a linear model.

Although the methods are not nested, hence precluding a log likelihood ratio test, we can compare raw values for each fit statistic.

R is powerful and agile language that is constantly undergoing improvements. As an open-source language, its utility is constantly expanded upon by user-contributed packages and additional developer resources. These include whole software packages like Rstudio, as well as tutorials, and cheatsheets. Keeping up with changes and advancements in this dynamic ecosystem is difficult. We have sought to provide resources for R users in agricultural research. We have established a central website to gather all related information, www.agstats.io that includes workshops, tutorials and short instructional blog posts. We also have built an accompanying âR Universeâ repository, https://idahoagstats.r-universe.dev intended to serve as a guide to existing R packages serving different facets of agricultural research. Our goal is to help agricultural researchers fully utilize the array of available R resources to reach their goals.\n","date":1652659200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652659200,"objectID":"84a0a5e2304d15153614fe88f9ca71d8","permalink":"/events/presentations/agstats-conference-2022/","publishdate":"2022-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/events/presentations/agstats-conference-2022/","section":"events","summary":"A poster on current R resources to support agriculture research.","tags":["R","CRAN"],"title":"Tools and Resources for R Users in Agricultural Research","type":"events"},{"authors":["Julia Piaskowski"],"categories":["R"],"content":"Last updated: July 29, 2022\nAgriculture encompasses a broad breadth of disciplines.

If you have been programming for any amount of time, you have learned that you are likely to encounter errors programming in R and resolving those coding errors can be challenging.\nFor most everyone, goggling an error message is the first step. This is not a bad choice as it often leads you to people who have already encountered the error and solved it. But, it can also lead you to a labyrinth of different, possible conflicting, possibly incomprehensible solutions. Additionally, it is not always the most time efficient method to solve a coding problem.\nSome Alternatives Check the documentation! There\u0026rsquo;s an ancient proverb about the importance of reading documentation: \u0026ldquo;you can spend 2 hours searching the web in order to save 15 minutes of reading the documentation.\u0026rdquo;\nPackage and function documentation can be very helpful. There are two main aspects of documentation:\n Function reference: this describes the arguments a function can take, the expected format for those arguments and information about the function object. It may also contain theoretical details that are needed to understand the argument options and examples. Documentation varies in quality greatly across R packages. It can occasionally be too bare bones to be useful, but often (especially in base R commands and tidyverse packages) the documentation is very detailed and helpful. Submission to CRAN requires that packages have a documentation file that lists all package function documentation in alphabetical order. Vignettes: these are tutorials accompanying how to use a package functions. These usually cover a subset of functions and include text explanations. They are basically long examples. Vignettes can be enormously helpful. They are not required for submission to CRAN, so they are not always available, especially for older legacy packages. You can find these on the package website (if it exists) or its CRAN link. Here are some vignettes from the package {tidyr}.  How do we find documentation? You find function documentation via the R console:\n?par # does an exact search on \u0026quot;par\u0026quot; ??plot # does a fuzzy match on \u0026quot;plot\u0026quot;  This will open help files for those items.\nSometimes, you will discover there are multiple options and possibly different help files associated with a function name (just run methods('mean') or methods('anova') to see what I mean).\nThese are functions that act differently depending on the R object type they are called to interact with (e.g. mean(some_dates) will behave differently than mean(some_numbers)). Which leads to the next point: all R objects have a class assigned to them. You can check this with class().\ny \u0026lt;- rnorm(20); x \u0026lt;- y + rnorm(20) m \u0026lt;- lm(y ~ x) class(y)  ## [1] \u0026quot;numeric\u0026quot;  class(m)  ## [1] \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;  Understanding this difference between functions will help you understand which documentation files will help you solve your problem.\nMore importantly, once you know the object class, you can search for methods that exist for that class.\nmethods(class = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;)  ## [1] add1 alias anova case.names coerce ## [6] confint cooks.distance deviance dfbeta dfbetas ## [11] drop1 dummy.coef effects extractAIC family ## [16] formula hatvalues influence initialize kappa ## [21] labels logLik model.frame model.matrix nobs ## [26] plot predict print proj qr ## [31] residuals rstandard rstudent show simulate ## [36] slotsFromS3 summary variable.names vcov ## see '?methods' for accessing help and source code  From this, we can see a special plot() option exists (that provides several diagnostic plots), functions for extracting residuals (rstudent(), residuals()), a version of anova() written for object type \u0026ldquo;lm\u0026rdquo;, and much much more.\nRead your error messages Error messages can be obtuse and confusing (especially if you are new to programming). We have all have experienced (and will experience again) this error message:\nIt is telling us we are trying to subset (extract) information from a \u0026lsquo;closure\u0026rsquo; (which is a function). In essence, there was an attempt to do something like mean$myvar when mean() is a function, not a data.frame.\nHowever, error messages can also be trying to tell you something important. Here\u0026rsquo;s a recent experience of mine:\nOver time, these messages will become comprehensible. It\u0026rsquo;s still the same messages, but your R knowledge will help you understand them. But, becoming fluent in R error messages implies reading them and trying to understand them.\nSpecific places to ask for help Eventually, you may need to search forums or ask for help from kind strangers. If Google fails you, here are some other useful resources:\n  RStudio Community, a helpful forum that is only for R questions. It is run by RStudio and moderated (to an extent). This is one of the more useful sites to search or post on.   R4DS community, a friendly, welcoming community. Join their slack channel and ask a question.\n  Stack overflow, the long-established site of all questions programming. Can often be helpful.   Consider reading the source code This is best for advanced users, but it can hep you resolve very specific questions about a function. Reading source code will also help improve your own coding.\n** How to find source code: **\n Type the function name in the console without parentheses:  mean.default  ## function (x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...) ## { ## if (!is.numeric(x) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !is.complex(x) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !is.logical(x)) { ## warning(\u0026quot;argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\u0026quot;) ## return(NA_real_) ## } ## if (na.rm) ## x \u0026lt;- x[!is.na(x)] ## if (!is.numeric(trim) || length(trim) != 1L) ## stop(\u0026quot;'trim' must be numeric of length one\u0026quot;) ## n \u0026lt;- length(x) ## if (trim \u0026gt; 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; n) { ## if (is.complex(x)) ## stop(\u0026quot;trimmed means are not defined for complex data\u0026quot;) ## if (anyNA(x)) ## return(NA_real_) ## if (trim \u0026gt;= 0.5) ## return(stats::median(x, na.rm = FALSE)) ## lo \u0026lt;- floor(n * trim) + 1 ## hi \u0026lt;- n + 1 - lo ## x \u0026lt;- sort.int(x, partial = unique(c(lo, hi)))[lo:hi] ## } ## .Internal(mean(x)) ## } ## \u0026lt;bytecode: 0x7fa5749f17f8\u0026gt; ## \u0026lt;environment: namespace:base\u0026gt;   Sometimes this is not informative  c  ## function (...) .Primitive(\u0026quot;c\u0026quot;)  subset  ## function (x, ...) ## UseMethod(\u0026quot;subset\u0026quot;) ## \u0026lt;bytecode: 0x7fa573afcb48\u0026gt; ## \u0026lt;environment: namespace:base\u0026gt;  `[`  ## .Primitive(\u0026quot;[\u0026quot;)   Use {the package {lookup} to find what you need  remotes::install_github(\u0026quot;jimhester/lookup\u0026quot;) lookup::lookup(`[`)  {lookup} checks CRAN, Bioconductor and GitHub for source code!

Sure, you can cut-and-paste and change that one thing, or two things, or five things, but this quickly becomes cumbersome. The result can be a very long R file and the likelihood of making a mistake that you don\u0026rsquo;t notice increases (e.g. forgetting to change a variable or an argument).\nThere is the general rule of DRY: don\u0026rsquo;t repeat yourself. In practice, if something has to pasted more than twice, then consider writing a function to accomplish that aim instead.\nIntroduction to Writing Functions R functions follow a general structure:\nmy_function_name \u0026lt;- function(argument1, argument2) { final_output \u0026lt;- action(argument1, argument2) return(final_output) }  A classic function example is conversion of temperature from Fahrenheit to celsius:\nfahr_to_cel \u0026lt;- function(fahr) { # function that converts temperature in degrees Fahrenheit to celsius # input: fahr: numeric value representing temp in degrees fahrenheit # output: kelvin: numeric converted temp in celsius celsius \u0026lt;- ((fahr - 32) * (5 / 9)) return(celsius) }  This function takes a numeric value, temperature in Fahrenheit, and outputs another numeric value, that same value converted to celsius.\nFunction usage:\nfahr_to_cel(80)  ## [1] 26.66667  This function can be called for a large number of values at once:\n# create a vector of 100 numbers randomly sampled between 1 and 100. x1 \u0026lt;- sample(1:100, 100, replace = TRUE) x2 \u0026lt;- fahr_to_cel(x1)  If you provide the incorrect type of data, the function will not work:\nfahr_to_cel(\u0026quot;thirty\u0026quot;)  ## Error in fahr - 32: non-numeric argument to binary operator  A More Complex Example Often we want to do something more complicated. One thing I want to do frequently is build boxplots.\nFirst, simulate some data. This data set has two categorical variables, cat1 and cat2, and 4 different continuous variables generated through data simulation.\nmydata \u0026lt;- data.frame(cat1 = rep(c(\u0026quot;A\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;B\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;D\u0026quot;), 10), cat2 = rep(c(\u0026quot;one\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;two\u0026quot;), each = 20), var1 = rnorm(40), var2 = runif(40), var3 = rlnorm(40), var4 = rbeta(40, 1, 5))  Next, write up an example of what you want to do. In this example, let\u0026rsquo;s create a boxplot:\nboxplot(var1 ~ cat1, data = mydata, main = NA, col = \u0026quot;orangered\u0026quot;)  Now, let\u0026rsquo;s put that in a function. Start with the basic function framework:\nboxplot_func = function() { }  Next, insert the function code. Start by cut-and-pasting the original boxplot command ran above:\nboxplot_func = function() { boxplot(var1 ~ cat1, data = mydata, main = NA, col = \u0026quot;orangered\u0026quot;) }  Decide on arguments you want to control and put that inside the function() parentheses. Probably the independent and dependent variable (x and y, respectively), as well as the data frame needed.\nPut those arguments inside function().\nboxplot_func = function(df, x, y) { boxplot(var1 ~ cat1, data = mydata, main = NA, col = \u0026quot;orangered\u0026quot;) }  Then indicate where those arguments are used in the function. They must be used in the function (otherwise, why have them?).\nboxplot_func = function(df, x, y) { boxplot(y ~ x, data = df, main = NA, col = \u0026quot;orangered\u0026quot;) }  However, if you try to use this function, it won\u0026rsquo;t work. The argument y ~ x is a special class of object in R called \u0026ldquo;formula\u0026rdquo; and the formatting and object type must match. Formulas are used widely in R for linear modelling and follow the exact same convention:\ny ~ x  Note that the information on either side of ~ can become more complicated. (but not in this function).\nSo, create a formula object using the functions formula() and paste() within the function and insert that into the basic boxplot code. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to use those function, type ?formula and ?paste into the console to learn more about them.\nboxplot_func = function(df, x, y) { f = formula(paste(y, \u0026quot;~\u0026quot;, x)) boxplot(f, data = df, main = NA, col = \u0026quot;orangered\u0026quot;) }  What if you want the ability to change the color? Insert a new argument and replace it in the function body:\nboxplot_func = function(x, y, color) { f = formula(paste(y, \u0026quot;~\u0026quot;, x)) boxplot(f, data = df, main = NA, col = color) }  If you want the option to set the some options or if you choose not to, have the function choose values automatically as defaults, that can be done by naming the argument in formula().\nboxplot_func = function(df = mydata, x, y, color = \u0026quot;springgreen\u0026quot;) { f = formula(paste(y, \u0026quot;~\u0026quot;, x)) boxplot(f, data = df, main = NA, col = color) }  Next step is to run the function as it is currently written (highlight the function code and click run). Next, make sure you add this function (i.e. boxplot_funct = function(...)) to your R environment by running it in the console. You can check it exists in your R global environment as thus:\nls()  ## [1] \u0026quot;boxplot_func\u0026quot; \u0026quot;fahr_to_cel\u0026quot; \u0026quot;mydata\u0026quot; \u0026quot;x1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;x2\u0026quot;  Now, call the function and make sure it does what we want?\nboxplot_func(mydata, \u0026quot;cat1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;var1\u0026quot;)  boxplot_func(x = \u0026quot;cat2\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;var1\u0026quot;, col = \u0026quot;darkcyan\u0026quot;)  boxplot_func(mydata, \u0026quot;cat2\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;var4\u0026quot;, col = \u0026quot;khaki\u0026quot;)  What if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t do what we want? What if you get strange output? No output? Or strange error messages? Herein comes the world of debugging (another blog post for another day).\nError Checking and Error Messages You may have noticed earlier this strange error message:\nfahr_to_cel(\u0026quot;thirty\u0026quot;)  ## Error in fahr - 32: non-numeric argument to binary operator  This is a very confusing message. We most certainly provided a \u0026ldquo;non-numeric argument\u0026rdquo;, but what is a \u0026ldquo;binary operator\u0026rdquo;? Turns out that is a programming speak for a standard mathematical operations addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (called \u0026lsquo;binary\u0026rsquo; because they take two inputs). Still, we are likely to encounter more strange error messages written in programmer speak that confuse us or someone else using our functions. We can write custom error messages that are produced when certain errors occur.\nHere is the temperature conversion function again:\nfahr_to_cel \u0026lt;- function(fahr) { celsius \u0026lt;- ((fahr - 32) * (5 / 9)) return(celsius) }  Since they can only take numeric argument, maybe we can start for checking for this? There are a few options in do this. One of the easiest to use is stopifnot(). This functions takes the general form: stopifnot(\u0026quot;my custom error message\u0026quot; = test). What constitutes a \u0026lsquo;test\u0026rsquo; is an R expression that returns a TRUE or FALSE value after being evaluated. Examples of this are is.character(x), is.NA(x), x \u0026gt; 0 and so on. For each of these statements, the expectation is that R will true a TRUE or FALSE. If the test does not do this reliably (e.g. you may not be able to evaluate x \u0026gt; 0 if x is non-numeric), then a different test is needed.\nIn our case, we can use is.numeric().\nfahr_to_cel \u0026lt;- function(fahr) { stopifnot(\u0026quot;input is not numeric\u0026quot; = is.numeric(fahr)) celsius \u0026lt;- ((fahr - 32) * (5 / 9)) return(celsius) }  Let\u0026rsquo;s run some test cases:\nfahr_to_cel(30)  ## [1] -1.111111  fahr_to_cel(\u0026quot;thirty\u0026quot;)  ## Error in fahr_to_cel(\u0026quot;thirty\u0026quot;): input is not numeric  As expected, the first one worked and the second generated an error message.\nNaturally, this is a very trivial example, but if you write more complicated functions with the intent of them automatically accomplishing a goal for you, these error messages can be helpful.\nFunctions and Tidy Evaluation If you\u0026rsquo;ve worked with the tidyverse, you know it handles input a bit differently. In summary, quotes are used far less often. This makes writing function quite challening at times and required the use of the double curly braces, {{}} or the \u0026ldquo;bang-bang\u0026rdquo; operator !!.\nWhat if we wanted to do a boxplot function using ggplot?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what the code would look like:\nlibrary(ggplot2) mydata \u0026lt;- data.frame(cat = rep(c(\u0026quot;AA\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;BB\u0026quot;), each = 50), obs = c(rnorm(50), runif(50))) ggplot(mydata, aes(x = cat, y = obs)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = cat), alpha = 0.5) + geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) + guides(fill = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) + theme_classic()  But, if you try to write a function following the usual rules, it won\u0026rsquo;t work properly:\ngboxplot_func \u0026lt;- function(x1, y1) { ggplot(mydata, aes(x = x1, y = y1)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = x1), alpha = 0.5) + geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) + guides(fill = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) + theme_classic() }  gboxplot_func(cat, obs)  ## Error in FUN(X[[i]], ...): object 'obs' not found  This one works, but the results are crazy.\ngboxplot_func(\u0026quot;cat\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;obs\u0026quot;)  Why are the results wonky? Because while this function see \u0026ldquo;mydata\u0026rdquo; has 100 observations, it cannot connect \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;obs\u0026rdquo; to the data frame.\nThis is where the special operators come in:\ngboxplot_func2 \u0026lt;- function(x1, y1) { ggplot(mydata, aes(x = {{x1}}, y = {{y1}})) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = {{x1}}), alpha = 0.5) + geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) + guides(fill = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) + theme_classic() }  gboxplot_func2(cat, obs)  The curly braces enable us to insert unquoted tidy variables and use ggplot.\nWhat if you have multiple options to specify in a single arguments? You can use the ... notation (in the final argument):\nvar_sum_funct(storms, day, name)[1:5,] # one grouping factor  ## # A tibble: 5 Ã 3 ## name Mean SD ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 AL011993 8.75 13.7 ## 2 AL012000 7.75 0.5 ## 3 AL021992 25.6 0.548 ## 4 AL021994 20.3 0.516 ## 5 AL021999 2.75 0.5  var_sum_funct(storms, day, name, status)[1:5,] # many grouping factors  ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'name'.

Unlike SAS, ANOVA functions in R lack a consistent structure, consistent output and the accessory packages for ANOVA display a patchwork of compatibility. The result is that it is easy to misspecify a model or make other mistakes. The information below is intended to serve as a guide through the R ANOVA wilderness.\nPackages Needed There are many packages to load. Here is a (very) brief summary of what each package does.\n   Package Purpose     car Anova() function to extract type III \u0026amp; II sums of squares   lme4 mixed models   nlme mixed models, non-linear models, alternative covariance structures   emmeans for extracting least squares means and contrasts   lmer test improved summary functions of lmer objects   dplyr data organization   forcats for managing categorical data   agridat has many agricultural data sets   agricolae has options for many common agricultural experimental designs    library(car) library(lme4) library(nlme) library(emmeans) #in older version of R, you may need to install \u0026quot;multcompView\u0026quot; separately to access full functionality of the emmeans package library(lmerTest) library(dplyr) library(forcats) library(agridat)  Formula Notation There are some consistent features across ANOVA methods in R. Formula notation is often used in the R syntax for ANOVA functions. It looks like this: $Y ~ X, where Y is the dependent variable (the response) and X is/are the independent variable(s) (e.g. the experimental treatments).\nmy_formula \u0026lt;- formula(Y ~ treatment1 + treatment2) class(my_formula)  ## [1] \u0026quot;formula\u0026quot;  my_formula  ## Y ~ treatment1 + treatment2  Often the independent variables (i,e, the treatments or the x variables) are expected to be factors, another type of R object:\nmy_var \u0026lt;- c(rep(\u0026quot;low\u0026quot;,5), rep(\u0026quot;high\u0026quot;, 5)) class(my_var) #check what variable type it is  ## [1] \u0026quot;character\u0026quot;  Although \u0026ldquo;my_var\u0026rdquo; is not type factor, it is type \u0026ldquo;character\u0026rdquo; which is automatically converted to a factor in lm(), lmer(), lme() and many other linear modeling functions. There are some packages that do not follow this convention, so it\u0026rsquo;s helpful to read function documentation, especially if you get unexpected results.\nVariables like year, which are often imported as a number or integer, do need to be converted to a factor or a character variable prior to analysis. Otherwise, they will be interpreted as a number in linear modelling and treated as a covariate, e.g, 2020 would be 2,020. Here is one way to do this conversion:\nmy_factor \u0026lt;- as.character(my_var) # convert to a character class(my_factor) # check variable type to confirm  ## [1] \u0026quot;character\u0026quot;  my_factor \u0026lt;- as.factor(my_var) # convert to a factor class(my_factor) # check variable type again to confirm  ## [1] \u0026quot;factor\u0026quot;  The choice of whether to convert a categorical variable to a character or factor depends on the comfort of the user with these structures and package requirements.\nSometimes, there is a need to alter the order of treatment levels (that is, how R sees those levels). The default behavior of R is to order categorical levels alphanumerically. However, sometimes there are reasons you may not want this (for example, you want to set a particular reference level as the first factor level).\nBelow is one example of how to reorder factor levels in a variable. The first step is to see which levels are present in the variable and how they are ordered:\nlevels(my_factor)  ## [1] \u0026quot;high\u0026quot; \u0026quot;low\u0026quot;  Once that is known, you can use that information to manually set the levels and their order. Note that spelling of each level much match what is actually present in the variable. Unmatched levels in the variable will be set to NA automatically by R in the following step.\nmy_factor \u0026lt;- factor(my_factor, levels = c(\u0026quot;low\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;high\u0026quot;)) levels(my_factor) # check the new ordering  ## [1] \u0026quot;low\u0026quot; \u0026quot;high\u0026quot;  Knowing the level order is important because in the implementation of ANOVA in R, the first level is treated as the reference level. Manipulating factors is a challenging task in R. The package forcats contains a collection of accessory functions for managing factors (\u0026ldquo;forcats\u0026rdquo; = for categories). The tutorial uses the forcats function fct_drop().\nMore on formulas:\nThe formula first shown, Y ~ treatment1 + treatment2, includes main effects only. Other formula notation includes the symbols : and *, indicating notation for interaction only and main effects plus the interaction term, respectively.\nformula(Y ~ treatment1:treatment2) # interaction only  ## Y ~ treatment1:treatment2  formula(Y ~ treatment1*treatment2) # interaction plus main effects  ## Y ~ treatment1 * treatment2  These two formulas are equivalent:\nformula(Y ~ treatment1 + treatment2 + treatment1:treatment2) formula(Y ~ treatment1*treatment2)  Perhaps you can see from these examples that formulas are a really just a collections of characters (that is, a string) and exist independent of any data set. Later, we will need to link these formulas to a data set to actually construct a linear model and conduct statistical analysis.\nANOVA for fixed effects models Here is a function for reporting the number of missing data in each column. There are other ways to do this, but I find this function easy enough to write and use.\ncount_na \u0026lt;- function(df) { apply(df, 2, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) }  Completely Randomised design First, load the data set \u0026ldquo;warpbreaks\u0026rdquo; (a data set from base R). This is an old data set with variables for wool type (A and B) and tension on the loom (L, M or H). The response variable is \u0026ldquo;breaks\u0026rdquo;, the number of times the wool thread breaks on industrial looms.\nI always like to have a quick look at the data before running any statistical tests. So, here we go:\ndata(warpbreaks) count_na(warpbreaks)  ## breaks wool tension ## 0 0 0  str(warpbreaks)  ## 'data.frame':\t54 obs. of 3 variables: ## $ breaks : num 26 30 54 25 70 52 51 26 67 18 ... ## $ wool : Factor w/ 2 levels \u0026quot;A\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;B\u0026quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... ## $ tension: Factor w/ 3 levels \u0026quot;L\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;M\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;H\u0026quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 ...  warpbreaks$wool \u0026lt;- factor(warpbreaks$wool, levels = c(\u0026quot;A\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;B\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;C\u0026quot;)) table(warpbreaks$wool, warpbreaks$tension)  ## ## L M H ## A 9 9 9 ## B 9 9 9 ## C 0 0 0  hist(warpbreaks$breaks, col = \u0026quot;gold\u0026quot;)  boxplot(breaks ~ wool, data = warpbreaks, col = \u0026quot;orangered\u0026quot;)  boxplot(breaks ~ tension, data = warpbreaks, col = \u0026quot;chartreuse\u0026quot;) #why not have colorful plots?  This data set has 2 treatments. We don\u0026rsquo;t know if there is an interaction between the variables, yet. A good start is to run a linear model using lm() function, the linear regression function. As a reminder, ANOVA is a special case of the linear regression model where the predictors (the experimental treatments) are categories rather than a continuous variable.\n# run standard linear model for main effects only lm.mod1 \u0026lt;- lm(breaks ~ wool + tension, data = warpbreaks) # extract type III sums of squares from that model Anova(lm.mod1, type = \u0026quot;3\u0026quot;)  ## Anova Table (Type III tests) ## ## Response: breaks ## Sum Sq Df F value Pr(\u0026gt;F) ## (Intercept) 20827.0 1 154.3226 \u0026lt; 2.2e-16 *** ## wool 450.7 1 3.3393 0.073614 . ## tension 2034.3 2 7.5367 0.001378 ** ## Residuals 6747.9 50 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1  # run a linear model with main effects and interactions lm.mod2 \u0026lt;- lm(breaks ~ wool*tension, data = warpbreaks) # ...and type III sums of squares Anova(lm.mod2, type = \u0026quot;III\u0026quot;)  ## Anova Table (Type III tests) ## ## Response: breaks ## Sum Sq Df F value Pr(\u0026gt;F) ## (Intercept) 17866.8 1 149.2757 2.426e-16 *** ## wool 1200.5 1 10.0301 0.0026768 ** ## tension 2468.5 2 10.3121 0.0001881 *** ## wool:tension 1002.8 2 4.1891 0.0210442 * ## Residuals 5745.1 48 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1  FYI\nfunctions only shown as an example and not actually run.\n# this function runs type II sums of squares: Anova(lm.mod2, type = \u0026quot;II\u0026quot;) # this function runs type I sums of squares: anova(lm.mod2)  A few comments on types of sums of squares: \nAs a reminder, the type of sums of squares used in statistical tests can impact the results and subsequent interpretation. Type I, sums of squares tests for statistical significance by adding one variable to the model at time (and hence is also called \u0026ldquo;sequential\u0026rdquo;). If there is any unbalance in the treatments, the type I sums of squares are dependent on the order variables are added to the model and hence is often not the best choice for many agricultural experiment. Type III sums of squares (also called \u0026ldquo;partial\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;marginal\u0026rdquo;) evaluates the statistical significance of variable or interaction, assuming that the other variables are in the model. This is a decent default option. The last option is Type II sums of squares, which is the best option when you are sure there are no interactions between variables. If there is complete balance among treatments (each treatment is observed the same number of times with no missing data), then there is no need to concern yourself with these different types of sums of squares.\nCompare Models # conduct an F test comparing the models anova(lm.mod1, lm.mod2)  ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Model 1: breaks ~ wool + tension ## Model 2: breaks ~ wool * tension ## Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(\u0026gt;F) ## 1 50 6747.9 ## 2 48 5745.1 2 1002.8 4.1891 0.02104 * ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1  # also, consider doing a stepwise approach for finding the best model: step(lm.mod2)  ## Start: AIC=264.02 ## breaks ~ wool * tension ## ## Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC ## \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 5745.1 264.02 ## - wool:tension 2 1002.8 6747.9 268.71  ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = breaks ~ wool * tension, data = warpbreaks) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) woolB tensionM tensionH woolB:tensionM ## 44.56 -16.33 -20.56 -20.00 21.11 ## woolB:tensionH ## 10.56  Model diagnostics plot(lm.mod2) #this will produce 4 plots of residuals  shapiro.test(resid(lm.mod2)) #standard shapiro-wilk test.  ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: resid(lm.mod2) ## W = 0.98686, p-value = 0.8162  # this variable could be analyzed with a log-normal model instead  Least squares means \u0026amp; contrasts The emmeans package is a flexible package for extracting the estimated marginal means (in SAS, the \u0026ldquo;least squares means\u0026rdquo;) from different linear models.

This in contrast to fixed effects, where the inferences are restricted to the treatment levels tested.\nBlocking factors and Year are often considered random factors because a researcher is not interested in particular years or a blocking factor. When there is unbalanced replication, the variance components should be estimated with maximum likelihood or REML, which implies use of the packages \u0026ldquo;lmer\u0026rdquo; and/or \u0026ldquo;nlme\u0026rdquo;.\nRandomised Complete Block Design (RCBD) - mixed effects The \u0026ldquo;shafii.rapeseed\u0026rdquo; data set will be used for this section.\nAnalyse experiment using a mixed model:\nThis uses the function lme() from the package \u0026ldquo;nlme\u0026rdquo;.

Don\u0026rsquo;t panic. Although SAS errors look confusing, SAS is really trying to help you find the problem. Really! Look in the Log Window for any error messages. They are marked in RED. Now, remember that SAS runs sequentially, top to bottom, so any mistakes at the top of the program will propagate more errors down the line. Always try to fix the first error you see, then rerun the program. You may find that when the initial problems are fixed, the rest of the errors will vanish. When SAS gives an error message, it also lists a numeric code, like 201 or 76 indicating the line and character in the line where it had trouble. SAS will also underline the offending part of the program and mark it with the numeric code so you can match an error message with the problem area. It can\u0026rsquo;t always find the exact place where the problem occurred, but it usually close by. For more debugging information take a look at the TIPS below on common mistakes and problems. Good Luck!\nMissing Quotes: If you\u0026rsquo;ve recieved the \u0026ldquo;longer than 200 characters\u0026rdquo; message then the cause of the problem is easy to find. You have left out a quote somewhere. Carefully go back through the program and check for both beginning and ending quotes in any statements that use quoted strings such as TITLE, INFILE, or AXIS statements . Quoted strings in SAS are color coded as a magenta color to make them easier to see. Large blocks of text appearing this color are an indicator of a missing quote. Also note that single quotes are different than double quote characters. If you start a string with one of these and end with the other type, SAS will indicate a missing quote.\nAfter you find the culprit, fix it. But wait! Correcting the problem is not quite that easy (somehow you knew that!). SAS builds up the code you run sequentially. So if you try to run the \u0026ldquo;corrected\u0026rdquo; code, SAS will STILL be looking for an ending quote from last time. The quotes will still be unbalanced and you\u0026rsquo;ll still get an error message. This can be very frustrating, but here is the solution. First, correct the code, but before you run it, open a new editor window. Next, give SAS what it is looking for, the offending single quote. In the new editor window enter this: '; and submit that as a program. This will satisfy SAS (ignore any error messages at this point). Then, go back to the original program and run it. The \u0026ldquo;quote\u0026rdquo; problem should go away.\nMissing Semicolons: Leaving out a semicolon is probably the easiest mistake to make. The error message you get may vary here depending on where the mistake was made. Usually you get a message like \u0026ldquo;variable XXX not found\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;invalid option\u0026rdquo;. SAS is trying to interpret the errant statement as part of the preceding statement and, therefore, gets it\u0026rsquo;s cyberfeet tangled. The solution is obvious: put in the missing ; and resubmit the program.\nMissing RUN Statement: Sometimes while running a program several times you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that the PROC LOTTERY you had at the end of your program is missing from the output listing. So, thinking that SAS maybe just \u0026ldquo;forgot\u0026rdquo; to run it the first time, you run the program again. Now you find it at the top of the output listing instead of the bottom! What the heck is going on!? Remember, SAS runs both sequentially and cumulatively. The first time you ran the program, SAS saw the PROC LOTTERY at the end, but didn\u0026rsquo;t find a RUN; statement. Without that it will hold on to the PROC LOTTERY and wait to execute it when it sees the next DATA or PROC step. When you run the program for the second time SAS first executes the PROC it is holding on to and then runs the submitted program (again leaving off the last PROC). This can cause confusion to no end (no pun intended!). The solution, of course, is to put in the missing RUN;. By the way, before you go running to your SAS manuals looking for PROC LOTTERY, remember this is only and example!\nLISTING Window/File: Like other portions of SAS, the Listing and Log windows or output files may be cumulative. If you know you have changed your calculations for yield from lbs to kilograms, but SAS seems to keep printing lbs in the output, make sure you have cleared out the Listing window. You are probably looking at an \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; output created before you changed things. This also applies to the Log window.\nCase problems: SAS is creating too many levels of a variable, for example, when running PROC MIXED, PROC GLIMMIX or PROC FREQ. Go back and check the data very carefully. Alphabetic variables are case sensitive so the value \u0026ldquo;Trt1\u0026rdquo; is different from \u0026ldquo;TRT1\u0026rdquo;. This problem often creeps into programs when data has been combined over several years or locations. If you have this type of data, try to formulate a consistent template for yourself and others to use for entering data. Define what the treatment codes and variable names will be ahead of time. The only way to handle this problem is to change the data or use a data step and the IF statement to correct the problem.\n0 and O problems: SAS keeps insisting that it can\u0026rsquo;t find your variable TRT0, but you know it\u0026rsquo;s there in the INPUT statement! Check things carefully. You may have used O (capital oh) instead of a zero. This is very easy to do and is made worse by the fact that the two are physically close together on most keyboards. Similar to problems with Case above, this mix up may also show up as a problem when reading in data. The only solution is to change the problem characters to the appropriate values and try again. If this problem occurs a lot, you might consider trying a different font which uses a dot or slash when writing a zero.\nGeneral Debugging Tips: Debugging SAS can be a trying experience. Here are some techniques I use to help the process.\n  Build long complex programs a step at a time. Start by reading in the data. Print it. Check it. Then do any calculations, then add PROCs and other DATA steps. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to write the whole thing at once. Verify that a piece of code works and then move on.\n  Use Comments. Try to isolate problem code by commenting out sections of the program. This is a very useful technique. See Comments.\n  Try writing programs with consistent and readable structure. Use line breaks and indentation where needed and throw in comments to explain what is happening in the program. This will help organize the program flow in your mind and point out where things are going wrong. See Programming Habits.\n  Stay calm! Learning the quirks of SAS takes time. If all else fails let us know!\n  Some SAS Resources for Error Corrections:   Simply copy and paste the error message into a search engine like Google.\n  Ask a question on the SAS forums:\n  Types of Errors in SAS\n  Beginning SAS books\n  Tips and Strategies for Mixed Modeling\n  ","date":1618444800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618444800,"objectID":"986bccb7753c0e7b812d0057ff373c0f","permalink":"/post/sas-troubleshooting/","publishdate":"2021-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/sas-troubleshooting/","section":"post","summary":"Common Errors and Corrections in SAS","tags":["SAS","Errors"],"title":"Common Errors and Solutions in SAS","type":"post"},{"authors":["Julia Piaskowski"],"categories":["R","reproducible research"],"content":"Install R: You can download R here. Get the correct R distribution for your operating system. Once downloaded, click on downloaded file, and follow the installation instructions.\nNote that R is updated several times per year. If your installation is a year old or more, consider updating your version of R to the latest version.\nInstall RStudio Rstudio is not R, rather, it is a user interface for accessing R. It is a complicated interface with many features for developers. Despite its complexity, RStudio is nevertheless a very helpful R user interface for users of all abilities. It can downloaded here. For most users, the free version of \u0026ldquo;RStudio Desktop\u0026rdquo; should be chosen. Once downloaded, click on downloaded file, and follow the installation instructions.\nInstall Rtools (optional) Only Windows users need to consider this step. This app is for compiling R packages with C, C++ and Fortran code. It is a separate piece of software that has to be downloaded and installed (it is not an R package). Rtools is not needed by all users and if you don\u0026rsquo;t know if you need this, it is absolutely fine to skip this step. If you do think you need this, You can find it here. Download and install.\nSetting up RStudio Setup (optional) This is an optional step, but it is highly recommended. This step will prevent RStudio from saving all of your objects in a session to .Rdata file that is then automatically loaded whenever you open R.\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;usethis\u0026quot;); library(usethis) usethis::use_blank_slate()  You can disable this across all projects in R with the drop-down menu Tools \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Global Options\u0026hellip; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; unclick \u0026lsquo;Restore .RData into workspace at startup\u0026rsquo; and set \u0026lsquo;Save workspace to .rRData on exit\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;Never\u0026rsquo;.\nWhy is automatic loading of an .Rdata file not recommended? Because it makes your work less reproducible. You may have created test objects that will unexpectedly interfere with downstream operations or analysis. You may have changed the original data source, but an older version is saved in the .Rdata file. More explanation is given by RStudio.\nIf you are used to opening R and seeing all of your previous objects automatically loaded into the objects pane, this will be an adjustment. The solution is to save your processes into .R scripts that capture all information from packages loaded, file import, all data manipulations and other operations important. If these steps are slow and there is a need to access intermediate objects, these can be saved in tabular formats readable by many applications (e.g. .txt or .csv) or saved as a specific R object (see saveRDS() in the R help files) and reloaded in another session.\nSet up version control (optional) If you use Git or SVN, you can perform Git operations directions from RStudio and interact with remote repositories. If you don\u0026rsquo;t use version control, this step can be skipped. If you do use version control, the command line or other third-party software (e.g. Gitkraken) are fine to use instead or in addition to RStudio\u0026rsquo;s interface. The implementation of git in R is very minimal and supports only a limited number of actions, so you are likely to need other software to perform complicated git actions. It is useful for file additions, commits, pushes and pulls.\nYou can set up Git by going to Tools \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Global Options \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Git/SVN.\nThis is not the right space to provide detailed instructions for using git as an R user, but Jenny Bryan has written a very helpful tutorial covering this subject.\n","date":1618444800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618444800,"objectID":"8b70804b6afa070131995606b8772ebd","permalink":"/post/getting-r-setup/","publishdate":"2021-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-r-setup/","section":"post","summary":"Some instructions for R installation and your R setup to support reproducible research.","tags":["R","reproducible research"],"title":"Getting R Set Up","type":"post"},{"authors":["Julia Piaskowski"],"categories":["R","reproducible research"],"content":"Make sure your Rstudio session is not saving .RData automatically: Note: this step requires the usethis package; please install this package if you do not already have it installed.\nStep 1 is to disable automatic saving of your objects to a .RData file. This file is automatically loaded when R restarts. Since we often create all sorts of miscellaneous objects during a session with a clear record of why, loading all objects without a clear sense of their provenance is often not reproducible by other.\nusethis::use_blank_slate()  You can read more about this function in its documentation.\nYou can disable this across all projects in R with the drop-down menu Tools \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Global Options\u0026hellip; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; unclick \u0026lsquo;Restore .RData into workspace at startup\u0026rsquo; and set \u0026lsquo;Save workspace to .rRData on exit\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;Never\u0026rsquo;.\nSave all code you run in an .R or .Rmd file This is your source code. It\u0026rsquo;s as real and as important as your input data. This file should capture a set of actions that can be repeated by another person (e.g. your PI, other colleagues yourself in the future) including packages loaded, files imported, all data manipulations and the outputs from these actions (e.g. visualisations, analytical outcomes). The idea is to capture your thought process and specific actions so this can be repeated in full. In most analyses, it is extremely likely* you will revisit a project and need to repeat what has already been done! Keeping a record of actions will save you considerable time because you will not have to attempt to recall and/or reconstruct exactly what you did in previous sessions.\n*Consider yourself very lucky if this does not happen!\nRegularly restart your R session Yes, that means wiping all the loaded packaged and objects from the session (if you followed the first recommendation in these instructions), but the upside is that your analysis are reproducible. This means future you can repeat those analyses and get the same results back you did earlier.\nYou can restart R by manually closing and opening RStudio. You can also restart the R session with RStudio by navigating to the menu item Session \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Restart R.\nUse R projects This is optional, but it will make your life easier. Whenever you start a new analytical endeavor in R, create an R project by navigating to File \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; New Project in RStudio. There are many options available for setting the [project directory (where the .Rproj file lives), the type of project (e.g. R package, Shiny app or blank), and options to initialise a git repo. The simplest option is to choose New Project (no special type) in a dedicated directory. The main advantage of projects is that by opening an .Rproj file, the working directory is automatically set to that directory. If you are using a cloud solution for working across different computers or working with collaborators, this will make things easier because you can use relative paths for importing data and outputting files. There would be no more need for this at the top of your script:\nsetwd(\u0026quot;specific/path/to/my/computer\u0026quot;)  Additionally, for setting up gitbooks through \u0026lsquo;bookdown\u0026rsquo;, R packages, Shiny apps, and other complicated R endeavors, the automated set-up through R projects can be immensely helpful. This is sometimes referred to as \u0026ldquo;project-oriented workflow.\u0026rdquo; In addition to using R projects with a dedicated directory for each research project, I also prefer to have a consistent directory structure for each project like this one:\ntop-level-directory â README.md â ââââdata â â file011.txt â â file012.txt â â â ââââspatial_files â â file208.dbf â â file208.shp â â file208.shx â ââââscripts â â eda.R â â analysis.R â â plots.R â â final_report.Rmd | ââââoutputs â â plot1.png â â blups.csv | ââââextra â some_paper.pdf â ...  I put all raw data needed for analysis into the \u0026lsquo;data\u0026rsquo; directory, any and all programming scripts in the \u0026lsquo;scripts\u0026rsquo; directory, all outputs (plots, tables, intermediate data object) in the \u0026lsquo;outputs\u0026rsquo; directory and everything else ends up \u0026lsquo;extra\u0026rsquo;. Naturally, there are many different directory structures to use and this is just one example. Find something that works best for your needs!\nUse the \u0026lsquo;here\u0026rsquo; package. This is also optional. It works like R projects for setting the working directory. However, for an R project to work, you have to open the .Rproj file in RStudio. What if you or your collaborators prefer to open R files directly and start using those? Here will look for the next directory level which there is a .Rproj file and set the working directory there.\nIf you want to import a file, \u0026ldquo;datafile.csv\u0026rdquo; that located in the data directory. Your .R script is actually located in the \u0026lsquo;scripts\u0026rsquo; directory. Normally, if you try to read that in, you need to specify the full path to \u0026ldquo;mydata.csv\u0026rdquo; or set the working directory and use a relative path. Again, these paths will not work if you switch computers or your collaborators are running these scripts on their own systems. This system gets even more complicated when working with an .Rmd file. Here\u0026rsquo;s an alternative approach that works the same across files and systems:\nFirst, make sure you have .Rproj file to define the top-level directory.\nlibrary(here) mydata \u0026lt;- read.csv(here(\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;datafile.csv\u0026quot;))  This code will construct this path: \u0026ldquo;data/datafile.csv\u0026rdquo; and execute that command under the assumption that wherever that .rproj is located (going up one directory at a time until it finds it) is where the working directory is set. Putting library(here) into every .R or .Rmd file in a project will resolve these issues.\nUse R environments. Again: optional, but it will make your life easier.\nOften in academia, I might do an analysis, move on to something else and then have to return that analysis months or years later. I probably will have updated R and some or all of the packages used in that analysis. As a result of these updates, my original code may not work at all or may not do the intended actions. What I need are both the older version of R and the older packages. The package \u0026lsquo;renv\u0026rsquo; is a solution. It captures the versions of R and the loaded packages. It also builds a custom package library for your package (and caches this information across other projects using renv).\nStart here: (you need to also be using Rprojects since renv is searching for .Rproj file)\nlibrary(renv) renv::init()  If you have a mature project that\u0026rsquo;s not undergoing any further development at this time, this is all you need to do.\nIf you continue to develop your project and install new packages, update your R environment like thus to ensure new or updated packaged are included:\nrenv::snapshot()  If you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with Packrat, this is a replacement for that. This is particularly helpful for things that may have a long life span, like Shiny apps. The renv package has extensive documentation worth reading.\nFinal Comments There are many more resources and recommendations for conducting reproducible research in R.
