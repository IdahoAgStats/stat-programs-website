This attribute of trial data impacts many aspects of spatial analysis\r\r\rSpatial autocorrelation refers to similarity between points that are close to one another. That correlation is expected to decline with distance. Note that is different from experiment-wide gradients, such as a salinity gradient or position on a slope.\nPlotting One of the easiest ways to diagnose spatial autocorrelation is by plotting data by its spatial position and using a heat map to indicate values of a response variable.\n\r While there is always ambiguity associated with using plots for decision making, early exploration of these plots can be helpful in understanding the extent of spatial correlation.\nMoran\u0026rsquo;s I Moran\u0026rsquo;s I, sometimes called \u0026ldquo;Global Moran\u0026rsquo;s I\u0026rdquo; can be used for conducting a hypothesis test on whether there is correlation between spatial units located adjacent to one another.\n$$ I = \\frac{N}{W}\\frac{\\sum_i \\sum_j w_{ij} (x_i - \\bar{x})(x_j - \\bar{x})}{\\sum_i(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\qquad i \\neq j$$\nWhere N is total number of spatial locations indexed by $i$ and $j$, x is the variable of interest, $w_{ij}$ are a spatial weights between each $i$ and $j$, and W is the sum of all weights.\nThe expected values of Moran\u0026rsquo;s I is $-1/(N-1)$. Values greater than the expected value indicate positive spatial correlation (areas close to each other are similar), while values less than that indicate dissimilarity as spatial distance between points decreases.\nDefining Neighbors There are several options for defining adjacent neighbors and how to weight each neighbor\u0026rsquo;s influence. The two common configurations for defining neighbors are the rook and queen configurations. These are exactly what their chess analogy suggests: \u0026ldquo;rook\u0026rdquo; defines neighbors in an row/column fashion, while \u0026ldquo;queen\u0026rdquo; defines neighbors in a row/column configuration an also neighbors located diagonally at a 45 degree angle from the row/column neighbors. Determining this can be complicated when working with irregularly-placed data (e.g. counties), but is quite unambiguous for lattice data common in planned field experiments.\n\r Setting the values for weights is a function of both how neighbors are defined and their proximity to the unit of interest. However, a very popular method is to define each neighbor as equal fractions that sum to one, e.g. in rook formation, each neighbor is weighted 0.25 (assuming an interior plot with 4 neighbors).\nEmpirical variogram This is one of the most useful methods of determining the extent of spatial variability and will be covered in the following sections.\nCode for this section R\r# load libraries\rlibrary(dplyr); library(ggplot2); library(desplot); library(spdep); library(sf); library(nlme)\r# read in data and prepare it\rNin \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;stroup_nin_wheat.csv\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(col.width = col * 1.2, row.length = row * 4.3) %\u0026gt;% mutate(name = case_when(is.na(as.character(rep)) ~ NA_character_, TRUE ~ as.character(gen))) %\u0026gt;% arrange(col, row)\rNin_na \u0026lt;- filter(Nin, !is.na(rep))\r# make exploratory plot\rggplot(Nin, aes(x = row, y = col)) +\rgeom_tile(aes(fill = yield), col = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) +\rgeom_tileborder(aes(group = 1, grp = rep), lwd = 1.2) +\rlabs(x = \u0026quot;row\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;column\u0026quot;, title = \u0026quot;field plot layout\u0026quot;) + theme_classic() +\rtheme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\raxis.title = element_text(size = 14),\rlegend.title = element_text(size = 14),\rlegend.text = element_text(size = 12))\r## conduct moran's I test ##\r# set neighbors with convenience function for grids\rxy_rook \u0026lt;- cell2nb(nrow = max(Nin$row), ncol = max(Nin$col), type=\u0026quot;rook\u0026quot;, torus = FALSE, legacy = FALSE) # run linear mixed model and extract residuals\rnin.lme \u0026lt;- lme(fixed = yield ~ gen, random = ~1|rep,\rdata = Nin, na.action = na.exclude)\rresid_lme \u0026lt;- residuals(nin.lme)\rnames(resid_lme) \u0026lt;- Nin$plot\r# two version of the Moran's I test: moran.test(resid_lme, nb2listw(xy_rook), na.action = na.exclude)\rmoran.mc(resid_lme, nb2listw(xy_rook), 999, na.action = na.exclude)\r  SAS\r# read in data\rproc format;\rinvalue has_NA\r'NA' = .;\r;\rfilename NIN url \u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IdahoAgStats/guide-to-field-trial-spatial-analysis/master/data/stroup_nin_wheat.csv\u0026quot;;\rdata alliance;\rinfile NIN firstobs=2 delimiter=',';\rinformat yield has_NA.;\rinput entry $ rep $ yield col row;\rRow = 4.3*Row;\rCol = 1.2*Col;\rif yield=. then delete;\rrun;\r# heatmap\rproc sgplot data=alliance;\rHEATMAPPARM y=Row x=Col COLORRESPONSE=yield/ colormodel=(blue yellow green); run;\r# linear mixed model\rproc mixed data=alliance;\rclass Rep Entry;\rmodel Yield = Entry / outp=residuals;\rrandom Rep;\rrun;\r# Moran's I\rproc variogram data=residuals plots(only)=moran ;\rcompute lagd=1.2 maxlag=30 novariogram autocorr(assum=nor) ;\rcoordinates xc=row yc=col;\rvar resid;\rrun;\r  ","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"fb80fd2ad66cac061f57b377665b0236","permalink":"/workshops/spatial-workshop/diagnosis/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/workshops/spatial-workshop/diagnosis/","section":"workshops","summary":"This workshop is concerned with areal data, that is, data that occurs in discrete units (plots, in most cases).

Here are a few popular examples.\nExponential\n$$ \\gamma (h) = \\begin{cases}0 \u0026amp; \\text{if }h=0 \\\\\nC_0+C_1 \\left [ 1-e^{-(\\frac{h}{r}) } \\right] \u0026amp; \\text{if } h\u0026gt;0 \\end{cases}$$\nwhere\n$$ C_0 = nugget $$ $$ C_1 = partial : sill $$ $$ r = range $$\n\r\rTheoretical Exponential Variogram\r Gaussian\n(a squared version of the exponential model)\n$$ \\gamma (h) = \\begin{cases}0 \u0026amp; \\text{if }h=0, \\\\\nC_0+C_1 \\left [ 1-e^{-(\\frac{h}{r})^2} \\right] \u0026amp; \\text{if } h\u0026gt;0 \\end{cases}$$\nwhere\n$$ C_0 = nugget $$ $$ C_1 = partial : sill $$ $$ r = range $$\n\r\rTheoretical Gaussian Variogram\r Matérn\n\u0026lt;/An extremely complicated mathematical model/\u0026gt;\n\r\rEmpirical Matérn Variogram\r There are many more models: Cauchy, logistic, spherical, sine, \u0026hellip;.\n\rFor more information on these models, see this workshop\u0026rsquo;s accompanying online book on this topic and additional SAS resources.\r\r\rVariogram fitting Picking the right model is done both by comparing the sum of squares of error for different models and by\nNot all variables have spatial autocorrelation\n\r Not all fitted variogram models are worthy\n\r\rVariogram gone bad\r Code for this section The following scripts build upon work done in previous section(s).\nR\r# load libraries\rlibrary(gstat); library(spaMM)\r# set up spatial object\rNin_spatial \u0026lt;- Nin_na\rcoordinates(Nin_spatial) \u0026lt;- ~ col.width + row.length # add attribte\rclass(Nin_spatial)\r# establish max distance for variogram estimation\rmax_dist = 0.6*max(dist(coordinates(Nin_spatial)))\r# calculate empirical variogram\rresid_var1 \u0026lt;- gstat::variogram(yield ~ rep + gen, cutoff = max_dist,\rwidth = max_dist/15, # 15 is the number of bins\rdata = Nin_spatial)\rplot(resid_var1) # empirical variogram\r#Note: To fit a large number of models, the function 'autofitVariogram()' from the package automap can be used (is it calling gstat::variogram)\r# starting value for the nugget\rnugget_start \u0026lt;- min(resid_var1$gamma) # initialise the model (this does not do much)\rNin_vgm_exp \u0026lt;- vgm(model = \u0026quot;Exp\u0026quot;, nugget = nugget_start) # exponential\rNin_vgm_gau \u0026lt;- vgm(model = \u0026quot;Gau\u0026quot;, nugget = nugget_start) # Gaussian\rNin_vgm_mat \u0026lt;- vgm(model = \u0026quot;Mat\u0026quot;, nugget = nugget_start) # Matern\r# actually do some fitting!

Incorporating spatial statistics into analysis of feel trials can be overwhelming at time. However, investigating spatial correlation in a field trial and controlling for it if necessary using any of the methods developed for this is recommended over doing nothing.\nThere is no denying that work is needed to develop scripts that automate this process so researchers can routinely incorporate spatial covariance into field trial analysis. Many current R tools are unwieldy to use and have insufficient options to support variety trial analysis.\nUntil this situation is improved, it is probably wisest to focus on using spatial models that are well-supported at this time. Any of the options implemented in the nlme package (or that work with that package) are decent choices with excellent support for extracting least-squares means, running ANOVA, and standard model diagnostics. Furthermore, nlme supports generalized linear models.

Get the correct R distribution for your operating system. Once downloaded, click on downloaded file, and follow the installation instructions.\nNote that R is updated several times per year. If your installation is a year old or more, consider updating your version of R to the latest version.\nInstall RStudio Rstudio is not R, rather, it is a user interface for accessing R. It is a complicated interface with many features for developers. Despite its complexity, RStudio is nevertheless a very helpful R user interface for users of all abilities. It can downloaded here. For most users, the free version of \u0026ldquo;RStudio Desktop\u0026rdquo; should be chosen. Once downloaded, click on downloaded file, and follow the installation instructions.\nInstall Rtools (optional) Only Windows users need to consider this step. This app is for compiling R packages with C, C++ and Fortran code. It is a separate piece of software that has to be downloaded and installed (it is not an R package). Rtools is not needed by all users and if you don\u0026rsquo;t know if you need this, it is absolutely fine to skip this step. If you do think you need this, You can find it here. Download and install.\nSetting up RStudio Setup (optional) This is an optional step, but it is highly recommended. This step will prevent RStudio from saving all of your objects in a session to .Rdata file that is then automatically loaded whenever you open R.\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;usethis\u0026quot;); library(usethis)\rusethis::use_blank_slate()\r You can disable this across all projects in R with the drop-down menu Tools \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Global Options\u0026hellip; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; unclick \u0026lsquo;Restore .RData into workspace at startup\u0026rsquo; and set \u0026lsquo;Save workspace to .rRData on exit\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;Never\u0026rsquo;.\nWhy is automatic loading of an .Rdata file not recommended? Because it makes your work less reproducible. You may have created test objects that will unexpectedly interfere with downstream operations or analysis. You may have changed the original data source, but an older version is saved in the .Rdata file. More explanation is given by RStudio.\nIF you are used to opening R and seeing all of your previous objects automatically loaded into the objects pane, this will be an adjustment. The solution is to save your processes into .R scripts that capture all information from packages loaded, file import, all data manipulations and other operations important. If these steps are slow and there is a need to access intermediate objects, these can be saved in tabular formats readable by many applications (e.g. .txt or .csv) or saved as a specific R object (see saveRDS() in the R help files) and reloaded in another session.\nSet up version control (optional) If you use Git or SVN, you can perform Git operations directions from RStudio and interact with remote repositories. If you don\u0026rsquo;t use version control, this step can be skipped. If you do use version control, the command line or other third-party software (e.g. Gitkraken) are fine to use instead or in addition to RStudio\u0026rsquo;s interface. The implementation of git in R is very minimal and supports only a limited number of actions, so you are likely to need other software to perform complicated git actions. It is useful for file additions, commits, pushes and pulls.\nYou can set up Git by going to Tools \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Global Options \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Git/SVN.\nThis is not the right space to provide detailed instructions for using git as an R user, but Jenny Bryan has written a very helpful tutorial covering this subject.\n","date":1618444800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618444800,"objectID":"8b70804b6afa070131995606b8772ebd","permalink":"/post/getting-r-setup/","publishdate":"2021-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-r-setup/","section":"post","summary":"Some instructions for R installation and your R setup to support reproducible research.","tags":["R","reproducible research"],"title":"Getting R Set Up","type":"post"},{"authors":["Julia Piaskowski"],"categories":["R","reproducible research"],"content":"Make sure your Rstudio session is not saving .RData automatically: Note: this step requires the \u0026lsquo;usethis\u0026rsquo; package; please install this package if you do not already have it installed.\nStep 1 is to disable automatic saving of your objects to a .RData file. This file is automatically loaded when R restarts. Since we often create all sorts of miscellaneous objects during a session with a clear record of why, loading all objects without a clear sense of their provenance is often not reproducible by other.\nusethis::use_blank_slate()\r You can read more about this function in its documentation.\nYou can disable this across all projects in R with the drop-down menu Tools \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Global Options\u0026hellip; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; unclick \u0026lsquo;Restore .RData into workspace at startup\u0026rsquo; and set \u0026lsquo;Save workspace to .rRData on exit\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;Never\u0026rsquo;.\nSave all code you run in an .R or .Rmd file This is your source code. It\u0026rsquo;s as real and as important as your input data. This file should capture a set of actions that can be repeated by another person (e.g. your PI, other colleagues yourself in the future) including packages loaded, files imported, all data manipulations and the outputs from these actions (e.g. visualisations, analytical outcomes). The idea is to capture your thought process and specific actions so this can be repeated in full. In most analyses, it is extremely likely* you will revisit a project and need to repeat what has already been done! Keeping a record of actions will save you considerable time because you will not have to attempt to recall and/or reconstruct exactly what you did in previous sessions.\n*This is almost guaranteed to happen!\nRegularly restart your R session Yes, that means wiping all the loaded packaged and objects from the session (if you followed the first recommendation in these instructions), but the upside is that your analysis are reproducible. This means future you can repeat those analyses and get the same results back you did earlier.\nYou can restart R by manually closing and opening RStudio. You can also restart the R session with RStudio by navigating to the menu item Session \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Restart R.\nUse R projects This is optional, but it will make your life easier. Whenever you start a new analytical endeavor in R, create an R project by navigating to File \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; New Project in RStudio. There are many options available for setting the [project directory (where the .Rproj file lives), the type of project (e.g. R package, Shiny app or blank), and options to initialise a git repo. The simplest option is to choose New Project (no special type) in a dedicated directory. The main advantage of projects is that by opening an .Rproj file, the working directory is automatically set to that directory. If you are using a cloud solution for working across different computers or working with collaborators, this will make things easier because you can use relative paths for importing data and outputting files. There would be no more need for this at the top of your script:\nsetwd(\u0026quot;specific/path/to/my/computer\u0026quot;)\r Additionally, for setting up gitbooks through \u0026lsquo;bookdown\u0026rsquo;, R packages, Shiny apps, and other complicated R endeavors, the automated set-up through R projects can be immensely helpful. This is sometimes referred to as \u0026ldquo;project-oriented workflow.\u0026rdquo; In addition to using R projects with a dedicated directory for each research project, I also prefer to have a consistent directory structure for each project like this one:\ntop-level-directory\r│ README.md\r│\r└───data\r│ │ file011.txt\r│ │ file012.txt\r│ │\r│ └───spatial_files\r│ │ file208.dbf\r│ │ file208.shp\r│ │ file208.shx\r│ └───scripts\r│ │ eda.R\r│ │ analysis.R\r│ │ plots.R\r│ │ final_report.Rmd\r|\r└───outputs\r│ │ plot1.png\r│ │ blups.csv\r|\r└───extra\r│ some_paper.pdf\r│ ...\r I put all raw data needed for analysis into the \u0026lsquo;data\u0026rsquo; directory, any and all programming scripts in the \u0026lsquo;scripts\u0026rsquo; directory, all outputs (plots, tables, intermediate data object) in the \u0026lsquo;outputs\u0026rsquo; directory and everything else ends up \u0026lsquo;extra\u0026rsquo;. Naturally, there are many different directory structures to use and this is just one example. Find something that works best for your needs!\nUse the \u0026lsquo;here\u0026rsquo; package. This is also optional. It works like R projects for setting the working directory. However, for an R project to work, you have to open the .Rproj file in RStudio. What if you or your collaborators prefer to open R files directly and start using those? Here will look for the next directory level which there is a .Rproj file and set the working directory there.\nIf you want to import a file, \u0026ldquo;datafile.csv\u0026rdquo; that located in the data directory. Your .R script is actually located in the \u0026lsquo;scripts\u0026rsquo; directory. Normally, if you try to read that in, you need to specify the full path to \u0026ldquo;mydata.csv\u0026rdquo; or set the working directory and use a relative path. Again, these paths will not work if you switch computers or your collaborators are running these scripts on their own systems. This system gets even more complicated when working with an .Rmd file. Here\u0026rsquo;s an alternative approach that works the same across files and systems:\nFirst, make sure you have .Rproj file to define the top-level directory.\nlibrary(here)\rmydata \u0026lt;- read.csv(here(\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;datafile.csv\u0026quot;))\r This code will construct this path: \u0026ldquo;data/datafile.csv\u0026rdquo; and execute that command under the assumption that wherever that .rproj is located (going up one directory at a time until it finds it) is where the working directory is set. Putting library(here) into every .R or .Rmd file in a project will resolve these issues.\nUse R environments. Again: optional, but it will make your life easier.\nOften in academia, I might do an analysis, move on to something else and then have to return that analysis months or years later. I probably will have updated R and some or all of the packages used in that analysis. As a result of these updates, my original code may not work at all or may not do the intended actions. What I need are both the older version of R and the older packages. The package \u0026lsquo;renv\u0026rsquo; is a solution. It captures the versions of R and the loaded packages. It also builds a custom package library for your package (and caches this information across other projects using renv).\nStart here: (you need to also be using Rprojects since renv is searching for .Rproj file)\nlibrary(renv)\rrenv::init()\r If you have a mature project that\u0026rsquo;s not undergoing any further development at this time, this is all you need to do.\nIf you continue to develop your project and install new packages, update your R environment like thus to ensure new or updated packaged are included:\nrenv::snapshot()\r If you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with Packrat, this is a replacement for that. This is particularly helpful for things that may have a long life span, like Shiny apps. The renv package has extensive documentation worth reading.\nFinal Comments There are many more resources and recommendations for conducting reproducible research in R.

The \u0026ldquo;one\u0026rdquo; in AR1 means that only the next most adjacent point is considered. There can be AR2, AR3, \u0026hellip;, ARn models.  The Separable AR1 x AR1 model   AR1xAR1 assumes correlation in two directions, row and column. It estimates $\\sigma$, $\\rho_{column}$, and $\\rho_{row}$ often a good choice since plot are rectangular and hence autocorrelation will differ by direction (\u0026ldquo;anistropy\u0026rdquo;)  More Notes on Separable AR1xAR1  From a statistical standpoint, it\u0026rsquo;s one of the more intuitive models The implementation in R is a little shaky  several packages, all hard to use and incompatible with other R packages   It is implemented in SAS Some proprietary software implements this (AsREML), others do not (Agrobase)  Semivariance and Empirical Variograms A measure of spatial correlation based on all pairwise correlations in a data set, binned by distance apart:\n$\\gamma^2(h) = \\frac{1}{2} Var[Z(s+h)-Z(s)]$\n$Z(s)$ = observed data at point $s$.\n$Z(s)$ = observed data at another point $h$ distance from point $s$.\nFor a data set with $N$ observation, there are this many pairwise points:\n$\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$\nEmpirical Variogram This uses semivariance to mathematically relate spatial correlations with distance\nrange = distance up to which is there is spatial correlation sill = uncorrelated variance of the variable of interest nugget = measurement error, or short-distance spatial variance and other unaccounted for variance\nSemivariance \u0026amp; Empirical Variograms  There are many difference mathematical models for explaining semivariance:  exponential, Gaussian, Matérn, spherical, \u0026hellip;   It is usually used for kriging, or prediction of a new point through spatial interpolation It can also be used in a linear model where local observations are used to predict a data point in addition to treatment effects Bonus: R and SAS are really good at this!

More Notes  When models omit blocking, the predictions may be unchanged or they may worsen. This varies by the agronomic field, but in general, blocking a field trial and including block in the statistical model improves your experimental power and controls experimental error. There is no single spatial model that fits all However, using any spatial model is usually better than none at all When you use spatial covariates, your estimates are better and more precise. This really does help you!  What\u0026rsquo;s Next:  Track row and range information in your trial data set. Look at the tutorial! (we will also add SAS code) Try out a few models and see how it impacts your results.  The Seminar Was Brought to you by\u0026hellip;Statistical Programs!!!
