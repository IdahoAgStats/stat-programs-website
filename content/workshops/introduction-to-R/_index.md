### Workshop content

In this workshop, participants will learn practical R programming skills for scientific data processing and analysis over the course of 30 hours of instruction and practice. The workshop will introduce the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/), the graphical user interface [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) and how R can be used to manage and analyze your data. At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

-   import & export data
-   understand data types and object types
-   filter, reshape, merge and manipulate your data
-   mathematically transform data
-   navigate R help files
