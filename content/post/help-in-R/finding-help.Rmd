## What do you do when you need to solve a problem in R? 

It does not need to to be stated (although I'm doing it anyways) that you are likely to encounter errors programming in R and resolving those coding errors can be challenging. 

For most everyone, goggling an error message is the first step (please let me know if this is not your first response!). This is not a bad choice as it often leads you to people who have already encountered the error and solved it. But, it can also lead you to a labyrinth of different, possible conflicting, possibly incomprehensible solutions. Additionally, it is not always the most time efficient method to solve a coding problem. 

## Some Alternatives: 

### Check the documentation!

How do we do this?

```{r eval=FALSE}
?par
??plot
```


(*Remember, you can spend 2 hours searching the web in order to save 15 minutes of reading the documentation).*

### No really, read the docs

This helps! There are two main aspects of documentation:   

1. Function reference (what was just discussed)
1. Vignettes

[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) can be a good place to start. 

[tidyr example](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyr)

[special box]
Sometimes, you will discover there are multiple options and possibly different help files associated with a function name (just run `methods("mean")` or `methods(anova)` to see what I mean). 

These are functions that act differently depending on the R object type they are called to interact with (e.g. `mean(some_dates)` will behave differently than `mean(some_numbers)`). Which leads to the next point: all R objects have a class assigned to them. You can check this with `class()`. 

```{r}
y <- rnorm(20); x <- y + rnorm(20) 
m <- lm(y ~ x)
class(y)
class(m)
```

Understanding this difference between functions will help you understand which documentation files will help you solve your problem.  

More importantly, once you know the object class, you can search for methods that exist for that class. 

```{r}
methods(class = "lm")
```
From this, we can see a special `plot()` option exists (that provides several diagnostic plots), functions for extracting residuals (`rstudent()`, `residuals()`), a version of `anova()` written for object type "lm", and much much more. 

### Read your error messages

*They are often telling you something important.*

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap="Informative error message I ignored"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/tweet_ignored_error.png')
```

Still, error messages can be confusing

Over time, these messages will become comprehensible. It's still the same messages, but your R knowledge will help you understand them. But, becoming fluent in "R error messages" implies reading them and trying to understand them. 


### Specific places to ask for help

* [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/)

* [R4DS community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/)

* [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

### Consider reading the source code

![read the source, luke](images/luke_source_code.jpeg)

*(this will help improve your coding, too)*

** How to find source code: **

* Type the function name in the console without parentheses: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
lm
```
*[suppressed output because it is long]*
<br><br>

* Sometimes this is not informative   
```{r}
c
subset
`[`
```


* Use 'lookup' to find what you need

*(Prior to 'lookup', finding source code for R functions was a real [bugger](https://github.com/jennybc/access-r-source#readme)*

**lookup** checks CRAN, Bioconductor and GitHub!

Please note that this 'lookup' is NOT the same same package called "lookup" found on CRAN. They have zero overlapping functionality. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("jimhester/lookup")
lookup::lookup(`[`)
```
