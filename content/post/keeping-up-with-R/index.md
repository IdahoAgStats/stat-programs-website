Finding the R packages that support your work can be challenging. Keeping up with the ongoing changes that occur in the R package ecosystem can be even harder. There are tools out there to ease this burden: 
  * [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) These topic-specific resources are intended as a general guide to R packages relevant to a topic. They are not exhaustive lists of every possible package. There is not an agricultural CRAN task view....yet (hence this blog post). 
  * [R Open Science](https://ropensci.org/) is running a new tool, [R Universe](https://r-universe.dev/search/) to provide organization-specific resources for package discovery and exploration. Idaho Ag Stats is running an [ag stats universe](https://idahoagstats.r-universe.dev/ui#packages) for the packages described in this post. 
  * [R weekly](https://rweekly.org/) provides weekly curated summaries by rotating curators on major developments in R. They have an RSS feed, too! 

Below is a compiled list of know R resources supporting agricultural research. Agriculture encompasses a broad breadth of disciplines. Many, many package in base R and contributed packages are useful to agricultural researchers. For that reason, this is not exhaustive list. It is intended to cover major packages that in most cases, have been developed to support agricultural research and analytical needs. 

Note that some of these packages are on CRAN and others are on GitHub, Bioconductor, or R-forge. 

If you think that a package is missing from the list, please [open an issue](https://github.com/IdahoAgStats/ctv-agriculture/issues) on the GitHub repo for this topic.  

## Core Packages with general applications

### Agricultural and landuse databases 
  
  Data from the United States Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistical Service '[Quick Stats](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Quick_Stats/)' web API can be accessed with [rnassqs][] or with [tidyUSDA][], which also offers some mapping capabilities. The USDA's [Cropland Data Layer](https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/) API can be accessed with [CropScapeR][] and [cdlTools][] provides various utility functions for processing CDL data. The package [rusda][] provides an interface to access the USDA-ARS Systematic Mycology and Microbiology Laboratory (SMML)'s [four databases](https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/Literature/Literature.cfm): Fungus-Host Distributions, Specimens, Literature and the Nomenclature database. USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey ([ARMS](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Ag_Resource_Management/)) data API can be accessed with [rarms][]. The USDA's Livestock Mandatory Reporting data API can be accessed with [usdampr][]. 
  
  [FAOSTAT][] and [faobulk][] can be used to access data from the [FAOSTAT Database](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home) of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. 
  
  [FedData][] provides access to geospatial data from The Soil Survey Geographic ([SSURGO](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/?cid=nrcs142p2_053627)) database, the Global Historical Climatology Network ([GHCN](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily)), the Daymet gridded estimates of daily weather parameters for North America, the [International Tree Ring Data Bank](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/international-tree-ring-data-bank-itrdb), and the [National Land Cover Database](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/national-land-cover-database#overview). The NOAA database API can be acccessed with [rnoaa][].
  
### Data sets
  
  [Agridat][] consists of a very large collection of agricultural data sets and example analyses; the package contains a vignette detailing additional data sets and extensive resources to support agricultural analysis. [agriTutorial][] provides a collection of agricultural data sets and analysis with particular attention to crop experiments. On GitHub, the repository [agroBioData][] houses a collection of data sets supporting agriculture and applied biology (note that this is a collection of CSV files, not a package). The [soybean nested associated mapping population data set](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28724064/) can be accessed via [SoyNAM][].  [simplePhenotypes][] can be used for simulating pleiotropic, linked and epistatic phenotypes. USGS county data on fertilizer sales can be explored with [ggfertilizer][]. The FAOSTAT data set collection on the Food and Agriculture Biomass Input–Output model (FABIO) is available through [fabio][] and described more in detail in [Bruckner 2019](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.9b03554). The R-forge subversion repository ['cropcc'](https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/pkg/?root=cropcc) hosts several R packages with climate change/cropping data set. Additionally, many  of the agriculture-focused packages listed in this guide also include data sets to illustrate their functionality (e.g. [BGLR][], [agricolae][], [FW][]).
 
### General analytical packages supporting agricultural research
  
  The package [nlraa][] provides nonlinear regression fucntions specifically for agricultural applications. [agriCensData][] is a flexible package for working with censored data (e.g. time to flowering, instrumentation values below the detection limit, disease scoring). The R suite of linear and non-linear modelling packages, [nlme][], [lme4][], and [MCMCglmm][] are useful for analysing a wide array of studies. The accessory package [emmeans][] works with those packages (and more) to calculated the estimated marginal means for the independent variables. The CRAN task view on [MissingData](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MissingData.html) is helpful for understanding how to impute for missing data. See the [Meta-analysis CRAN task view](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MetaAnalysis.html) for packages supporting meta-analyses.   

## Discipline-specific packages

### Agricultural economics
