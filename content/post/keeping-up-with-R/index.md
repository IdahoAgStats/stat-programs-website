Finding the R packages that support your work can be challenging. Keeping up with the ongoing changes that occur in the R package ecosystem can be even harder. There are tools out there to ease this burden: 
  * [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) These topic-specific resources are intended as a general guide to R packages relevant to a topic. They are not exhaustive lists of every possible package. There is not an agricultural CRAN task view....yet (hence this blog post). 
  * [R Open Science](https://ropensci.org/) is running a new tool, [R Universes](https://r-universe.dev/search/) to provide organization-specific resources for package discovery and exploration. Idaho Ag Stats is running its an [ag stats universe](https://idahoagstats.r-universe.dev/ui#packages) mimicking the information in this post
  * [R weekly](https://rweekly.org/) provides weekly curated summaries by rotating curators on major developments in R. They have an RSS feed, too! 

Below is a compiled list of know R resources supporting agricultural research. Agriculture encompasses a broad breadth of disciplines. Many, many package in base R and contributed packages are useful to agricultural researchers. For that reason, this is not exhaustive list. It is intended to cover major packages that in most cases, have been developed to support agricultural research and analytical needs. 

Note that some of these packages are on CRAN and others are on GitHub, Bioconductor, or R-forge. 

If you think that some package is missing from the list, please [email me](mailto:jpiaskowski@uidaho.edu) and let me know.  

## Core Packages with general applications

### Agricultural databases 
  
  Data from the United States Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistical Service 'Quick Stats' web API can be accessed with [rnassqs][] or with [tidyUSDA][], which also offers some mapping capabilities. The USDA's Cropland data layer API can be accessed with [CropScapeR][]. [cdlTools][] provides various utility functions for working with the CDL. [rusda][] provides an interface to access the USDA-ARS Systematic Mycology and Microbiology Laboratory (SMML)'s four databases: Fungus-Host Distributions, Specimens, Literature and the Nomenclature database. USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) Data API can be accessed with [rarms][]. [FedData][] provides access to geospatial data from The Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database, the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), the Daymet gridded estimates of daily weather parameters for North America, the International Tree Ring Data Bank, and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The USDA's Livestock Mandatory Reporting data API can be accessed with [usdampr][]. [FAOSTAT][] and [faobulk][] can be used to access data from the FAOSTAT Database of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. There are many options for downloading current and historic weather data. This is generally beyond the scope of this guide, but [rnoaa][] one option to get you started for accessing NOAA data.
  
### Data sets
  
  [Agridat][] consists of a very large collection of agricultural data sets and example analyses; the package contains a vignette detailing additional data sets and extensive resources to support agricultural analysis. [agritutorial][] provides a collection of agricultural data sets and analysis with particular attention to crop experiments. On GitHub, the R package [agroBioData][] also includes a collection of data sets supporting agriculture and applied biology. The soybean nested associated mapping project data set can be accessed via [SoyNAM][]. Many packages also include data sets to illustrate their functionality. [simplePhenotypes][] can be used for simulating pleiotropic, linked and epistatic Phenotypes. USGS county data on fertilizer sales can be accessed with [ggfertilizer][]. The FAOSTAT data set collection on the Food and Agriculture Biomass Inputâ€“Output model (FABIO) is available through [fabio][] and described more in detail in [Bruckner et al](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.9b03554). 
 
### Miscellaneous analytical applications for agriculture 
  
  [nlraa][] Nonlinear Regression for Agricultural Applications. The CRAN task view on [MissingData](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MissingData.html) is helpful for understanding how to impute for missing data. See the [Metanalysis CRAN task view](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MetaAnalysis.html) for packages supporting meta-analyses. Additionally, the R suite of linear and non-linear modelling packages, [nlme][], [lme4][], and [MCMCglmm][] are useful for analysing a wide array of studies. The accessory package [emmeans][] works with those packages (and more) to calculated the estimated marginal means for the independent variables. [fertplan][] provides fertilizer recommendations based on soil test results (note this packages is optimized for horticultural crop production in Italy). 

## Discipline-specific packages
