R is notoriously difficult, finicky and at times, needlessly challenging (note that I just said the same thing three times, but the repetition is for emphasis). R is also powerful, flexible and extraordinarily nimble. If you want to try out that great new thing, it's probably possible to do it in R without programming it from scratch. But, I'm not doing you any favors by pretending that learning R is easy and painless. It is hard. R is a powerful programming language, and as usual, with great power, comes *a lot* of learning, practice and preparation to know how to use those powers.

In time, you may find you truly love solving the various logic puzzles R puts before you. Or not.  Regardless, I wish you the best on your journey to learning R. This far from a comprehensive list (that's not the point), but here are a few resources to help get you started.
