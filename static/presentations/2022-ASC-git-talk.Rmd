# Collaborate: File Issues

- Point out a bug (or find out if someone else has this problem)
- ask developer to add feature

# Version Control

Version control captures changes across files, describing the difference between each and maintaining a linear history that can be rewound if needed.

# Why Might You Need This? 
 
You're already doing an ad hoc version control.

# Why Might You Need This? 
 
#### *Reproducible Research*

> ...reproducibility is obtaining consistent results using the same input data; computational steps, methods, and code; and conditions of analysis. This definition is synonymous with “computational reproducibility”

# What is Git and GitHub not suitable for

* Making publication data sets available - this is not an appropriate long-term repository
* Tracking changes in binary files (.doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .pdf)

There are special tools to work with large files - make sure you use those if your files are large!

# Lesson 1: Take learning git seriously

# Learning git

* Those 2-hour workshops are a good way to get started!

* But more training is needed. You will find yourself in a sticky situation that only you can resolve. Do you want to implement a mystery solution you found on Stack Overflow and rick data loss??

Decent options: 
  * [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/)
  * [Software Carpentry git workshop](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
  * [Thee book of git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

# Lesson 2: Use a Git Client

![](git_talk/git_kraken.png)

---
# Some Graphical User Interface

* GitHub GUI
* Git Kraken
* SourceTree
* ....[tons more](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)

The goal is to become accustomed to using git regularly - use the tools that help you reach that. 

---
# Lesson 3: Be Patient When an Error Occurs

When the inevitable error happens:
  * a merge error
  * can't pull or push!
  * a `git revert` gone horribly wrong
  
Proceed with caution! 

All can be untangled - if you act wisely. It's also very possible to make things irreversibly worse! 

---
# Lesson 4: Don't Expose Secrets

* Learn about and use the `.gitignore` file
* Consider private repositories when appropriate
* There are some guidelines regarding legal compliaence (e.g. [HIPAA](https://github.com/truevault/hipaa-compliance-developers-guide))
