## Data Analysis 
  
- math calculations
- [statistical analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)
- [deep learning](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/)
- [natural language models](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/NaturalLanguageProcessing.html)
- [GIS and spatial applications](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html)

R has a solution for everything.

## Data Preparation
  
*Rarely is data ready to use after the initial acquisition.* 
  
![](data_cleans_itself.png)

---
  
## Data preparation
  
- remove impossible values
- find out why there are so many duplicates! 
  - "name disambiguate" (e.g. J. Piaskowski, Julia Piaskowski, Julia L. Piaskowski, Dr. Piaskowski, JL Piaskowski, ...)
- [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) - suite of packages to do this!
  
  
---
  
## Data preparation is time consuming
  
![](pie_chart.png)


---
  
## Connect with data sources
  
- internal or external database
- packages for connecting to any API: [httr](https://httr.r-lib.org/), [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html)
- packages for working with specific API, e.g. [rnassqs](https://docs.ropensci.org/rnassqs/) for accessing data from NASS '[Quick Stats](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/)' or [spotifyr](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/) for accessing Spotify's API

## Write & publish reports
  
- Includes narratives: introduction, discussion, conclusion, etc
- Use R code to run analysis and output results and/or illustrative plots
- Embed mathematical equations, images, tables of results, diagrams
- [Example](https://agstats.io/post/anova-in-r/)
